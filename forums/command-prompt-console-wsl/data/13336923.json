Yes I have internet, Yes I can browse using a browser. I can pull up webpages I've never been to. I can ping an ip address etc etc etc. I also went directly to the file it was attempting to download and was able to download the deb it couldn't find. I even did an apt-get update. Still can't connect to ubuntu servers. It has to do with the bash itself. This is very upsetting because I've seen videos with other people being able to install git and other repositories just fine. If anyone had this problem or can help me fix this that be great!","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/156786033","datetime":"2016-04-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/313122400-sankarshan-mridha","datetime":"2017-01-26","body":"If your internet connection goes via proxy then \n<br>Set export http_proxy, https_proxy in .bashrc \n<br>Then run\n<br>Source .bashrc followed by \n<br>Sudo -E apt-get update\n<br>Sudo -E apt-get install &lt;package-name&gt;\n"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/218427462-yashar-fakhari","datetime":"2016-11-19","body":"I think this is resolved now"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158008299-mathisen","datetime":"2016-04-08","body":"just add &gt; nameserver  8.8.8.8   \n<br>in  /etc/resolv.conf"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/157489704-andrew-hoefling","datetime":"2016-04-06","body":"I did a little more research on this issue, it looks like my command prompt can ping google.com but when I am in bash I am unable to ping google.com"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/157489704-andrew-hoefling","datetime":"2016-04-06","body":"I'm having the same issue on 14316, I have tried disabling my firewall and it is still not working.
