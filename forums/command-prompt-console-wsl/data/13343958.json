It uses a special set of ANSI escape codes to set the colors of 6-pixel wide columns per ASCII character, and is one of the few relatively standard ways to have graphics inside a terminal emulator.","votes":"13","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/157622625-wesley-a-wigham","datetime":"2016-04-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158134188-mobluse","datetime":"2016-10-07","body":"Sixel works now in Bash on Ubuntu on Windows but requires Xming and MLTerm or XTerm. I’ve recompiled GnuPlot from the Ubuntu 16.04 distribution with support for Sixel graphics (set term sixel). GnuPlot is in turn used by Octave and other big data programs. It’s very useful to have the diagrams in the terminal and not in some popup window, because one can e.g. scroll back, know where to look, and can avoid the mouse. It would also be easier to install these big data programs if one doesn’t need Xming."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/157804557-%E6%AC%A7%E6%96%87","datetime":"2016-04-07","body":"Yes, this would be an excellent idea. Sixel is getting to be more and more common on the Linux side, yet there are far more Windows workstations in the world than Linux. Supporting Sixel in conhost (assuming it doesn't significantly delay opening a shell) would be an excellent way to make Windows the preferred development environment!"}]}
