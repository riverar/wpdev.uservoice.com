WSL seems like such an amazing concept, but fails on so many fronts. how are WE are developers expected to a use a tool that does not support a wide range of legacy tools that are out there. The rational of leaving this feature behind(unless it will completely destroy everything in the process) is mind boggling stupid. Even Windows supports 32 bit application, so why would you need do the same for this feature????"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/881788354","datetime":"2019-01-27","body":"Oh man, this response... fail."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/659984869-andrei","datetime":"2019-01-05","body":"@Microsoft, please add the workaround link for this issue from github:\n<br>link: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2468#issuecomment-374904520\">https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2468#issuecomment-374904520</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/875562553","datetime":"2018-12-14","body":"+1\n<br>Many professional products still use 32-bit libraries (for example, IBM DB2, ...).

But the way around this is simply to install you favorite linux directly on metal ( your hardware ), then install virtualbox for linux and then install windows 10 inside of virtualbox.  It's fairly simple.  Then you can run all your favorite linux and windows programs at the same time, natively in each.  Once everything is installed, you can select seamless mode in virtualbox.
