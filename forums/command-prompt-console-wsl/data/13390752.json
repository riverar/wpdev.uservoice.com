I have tried the command in Bash \"set bell-style none\" and right-clicking the application header in Windows to select Properties which has no option for silencing the terminal bell. Those are the two places I would imagine it to be implemented, so take this as a suggestion if it is implemented in another location.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158906043-jsd1710","datetime":"2016-04-11","comments":[]}
