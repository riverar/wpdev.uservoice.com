Obviously there is a way to run linux programs in windows, since it is happening in the Bash program, but how could a developer access this? For example, possibly making our own terminal emulator on windows?","votes":"20","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160631088-josh-phillips","datetime":"2016-04-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/673370176-musa-malak","datetime":"2017-09-22","body":"no comment/ good program"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/164361588-martyn-hare","datetime":"2016-05-03","body":"This has been made with Linux Subsystem for Windows :D"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160182792-chris-hacking","datetime":"2016-04-28","body":"Well, the simple-but-hacky way to do it is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe -c \"&lt;/path/to/Linux/program&gt; --arguments\"` You can do this from the command line anywhere, or programmatically using CreateProcess or similar. A better way to do it programmatically would be cool, but it wouldn't be strictly *necessary*."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160631088-josh-phillips","datetime":"2016-04-19","body":"@Ivan It's an interesting idea. I might play around with it more if I can, but I think bash is a little more complicated than just ssh since there still is no linux kernal running. However it's a little unclear how and where system calls are translated between the OS's which is guess is more the question here"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160650612-ivan-pierre","datetime":"2016-04-18","body":"It's not, service not started. cannot connect to Upstart.
