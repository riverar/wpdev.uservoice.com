A great example of the risks this would mitigate can be found here: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste\">https://thejh.net/misc/website-terminal-copy-paste</a>\n<br>I know this isn't a huge risk, but I think it would a be a nice feature to have enabled by default.
