The image alone is ~700 MB before using apt-get or installing any pre-packaged software from the repositories. Adding an option to move or install to a location other than \"C:\\Users\\[UserName]\\AppData\\Local\\lxss\" would be greatly beneficial; especially for those of us who manage our SSD / OS partition sizes carefully and using symbolic links can get messy.
