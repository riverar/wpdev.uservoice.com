Software Carpentry is determined to make basic coding available to Windows users, and with Microsoft's terrific move in *nix space, this should a priority. Once students/learners realize that they can manipulate scripts as textfiles, confidence grows and they start to progress rapidly. Using GitHub (with recent changes in markdown standards) make this a little more difficult, and using a text editor should not be a bottleneck to learning. This isn't to demean what's out there, but I'm speaking as an advocate for the coder-wannabes (and there are a LOT of them). Maybe not making all windows files accessible is possible right now, but a couple text editors would go a long way IMHO (set up bash submission scripts, experimenting with regular expressions, checking configuration files...).
