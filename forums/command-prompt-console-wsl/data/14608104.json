To cite myself from the issue you linked: As far as I understand split tokens in UAC - non-elevated processes of users in admin groups (it's RID based, msdn has the details) can never have that privilege. Even if you edit the group policy to add it for everyone that just gets filtered out with no way to override it. Imho this is a major pita and it has bitten me outside of this specific issue. It makes using symlinks on dev setups (whose accounts tend to have admin rights) nearly impossible. Basically you can make it work for the Guest account but not without elevation for an admin :( Would love to see that resolved."}]}
