I've tried vt102, ansi, linux and xterm.  For instance, the up arrow for history always displays a capital A, and down is a capital B.  If you hold the up or down arrows, they do start looping through the history.  That's just one example.  Otherwise, I am loving this bash!  Thank you!","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/173614671-jason-davis","datetime":"2016-06-07","comments":[]}
