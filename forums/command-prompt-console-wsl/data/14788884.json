Which means that if you have multiple users on the same computer, they will all have their own copies of the executables which is going to seriously eat into server space and Im not sure this will work under a roaming profile.\n<br> \n<br>So the Bash shell and anything installed under it is treated more like a Windows Store app.  While I can sort of see the reasoning behind it, it really doesn't help in a university environment.\n<br> \n<br>This seems such a shame since this would allow us to expose users to both Windows and Linux environments much easier.   Do you know of anyone else who is looking at this in an education environment/scenario? I am sure other Unis will want this and kill dual boot environments.\n<br> \n","votes":"27","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/174923634-lee-stott","datetime":"2016-06-11","comments":[]}
