But MPI, while it runs, appears to run at a lower performance often causing timeout errors.  I don't know enough about system architecture but better MPI support and overall performance would be very appreciated","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/208918284-jordan-cox","datetime":"2016-08-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/360515179-bruce-allen","datetime":"2017-04-19","body":"I have had much success building OpenMPI, FFTW3 in support of building LAMMPS. I would like to see WSL enhanced to allow OpenMPI to talk to other Win 10 nodes so LAMMPS could run across multiple nodes. If it's possible, please post some details. Thanks."}]}
