Since that method of invoking bash results in a console window and interactive prompt, I'm thinking most bash users automatically assume it is opening a login shell. (The main difference is the reading of /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile. It currently only processes the corresponding bashrc files. )","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/165974238-m-cook","datetime":"2016-08-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/665088889-no-software-no-bugs","datetime":"2017-09-08","body":"why not to add a -h option to explain this?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/283251376-tibor-gyimesi","datetime":"2016-11-15","body":"I like this idea, but for starters it would nice if on the bash start .profile script would take effect."}]}
