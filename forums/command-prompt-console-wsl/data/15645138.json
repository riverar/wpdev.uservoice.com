However annoying issue \"Fatal error in MPI_Init\" surfaced while executing mpi-built binaries regardless of single of many cores (eg. with or without mpiexec). I found that by adding \"127.0.1.1 myhostname\" into /etc/hosts, right after \"127.0.0.1 localhost\" line, makes things with MPICH to work well again. (Of course \"myhostname\" is the local hostname.) Now it works under any Windows network arrangement. (The latest MPICH 3.2 source should be taken from \"<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.mpich.org/%22\">http://www.mpich.org/\"</a>, and built upon any compiler.) This issue with hosts resolution should be double checked.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/216424884-caesar","datetime":"2016-08-12","comments":[]}
