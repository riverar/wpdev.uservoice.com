(Just feedback.)","body":"There are some incredibly powerful computational libraries used in scientific supercomputing community that are very difficult to bring into Windows Visual Studio environment for development, even under cygwin for that matter. I have successfully built and tested latest PETSc 3.7.3 (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation) and SLEPc 3.7.2 (Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations) under WSL Bash. These libraries were build on top of the latest MPICH 3.2 with 5-th generation gnu compilers (c/c++/fortran). It all works like magic! Some of the benchmarking is equally impressive. Bash is one of the most amazing features in the AE Win10, as for some of us this eliminates the dual-boot or VM setups that deplete resources. Thank you for the great job you guys!!!","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/216424884-caesar","datetime":"2016-08-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/286477070","datetime":"2016-11-22","body":"Could you tell me how to install PETSc 3.7.3  on Windows Visual Studio environment?\n<br>If you want, could you send me your project of PETSc 3.7.3 to my Email.\n<br>My Email is <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:schoolhui@hotmail.com\">schoolhui@hotmail.com</a>.\n<br>Thank you very much!"}]}
