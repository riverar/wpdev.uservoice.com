This includes keyboard shortcuts (for which as long as I can remember using the terminal in Windows never worked in the first place). Things like if I paste into the terminal using the shortcut provided in the menu (Ctrl+V) I should NEVER just get a \"^V\" placed in my terminal. Why have shortcuts if they are completely useless? For someone who uses the terminal often, why should I need to go to a menu just to highlight some text to copy and paste (because again Ctrl+M never seems to work)? Why not simply start highlighting and automatically copy to the clipboard what I highlight? Why are the interactions so poorly done? Please, while the terminal is being worked on, improve these user interactions. The current state of things makes for an extremely poor user experience.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/221483424-benjamin-baldivia","datetime":"2016-08-17","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/277058941-christian-seibold","datetime":"2016-11-04","body":"You can do copy and paste in cmd now!"}]}
