In my case, I'm not interested in the VPN/OpenVPN stuff, but rather to be able to run OpenSource projects like Hercules in the Windows Bash Shell. Other applications too need the TUN/TAP interface.\n<br>As I understand it, other Linux networking features are also still missing from the Windows Bash Shell, e.g. the traceroute command still does not work (as of 1-Sep-2016; setsockopt IP_MTU_DISCOVER: Invalid argument).\n<br>Microsoft's commitment to add TUN/TAP and other missing networking elements to the Windows Bash Shell would be very much appreciated.\n<br>Peter Jansen"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/225118168-krzysztof-antczak","datetime":"2016-08-22","body":"BTW. on this screenshot, we can see Xvfb + Fluxbox + x11vnc + xterm ;-)"}]}
