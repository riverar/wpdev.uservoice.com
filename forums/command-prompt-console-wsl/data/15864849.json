In the settings dialog the additional sizes are listed and the preview shows them correctly but in the actual console windows only the build-in bitmap fonts are used. Still worked in 1511.\n<br>This is the case at least with my fonts which worked fine since Windows 95. They have the OEM flag and the face name is Terminal.\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.uwe-sieber.de/dosfon_e.html#download\">http://www.uwe-sieber.de/dosfon_e.html#download</a>","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/230334939-uwe-sieber","datetime":"2016-08-30","comments":[]}
