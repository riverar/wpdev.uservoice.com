This means that in order to get correct cursor movement, I need to manually enable Insert Mode each time I launch bash.exe.  Otherwise, the text that I see in the terminal doesn't necessarily align with what I'm actually typing.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/167184705-paul-buonopane","datetime":"2016-09-12","comments":[]}
