This could give you the option to run many shells, shutdown/restart/rebuild from menu clicks and most importantlyleave it running in the background and maybe give you basic proc/mem/io usage from the systray mouse over.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/242379862","datetime":"2016-09-14","comments":[]}
