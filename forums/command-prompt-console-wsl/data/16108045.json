In my case, I have a GTX1060 6GB, and I can only use 4.5 GB of VRAM to run my deep neural networks. These 1.5 GB are really useful when dealing with huge networks! In this case, it is better to keep using Linux where I can use all 6GB of VRAM. Apparently, Microsoft knows this, but have done nothing to improve the situation."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/209482473-kenneth-benson","datetime":"2019-08-28","body":"&lt;sigh&gt; Just as well I've been saving for a new B-I-Y(build it yourself) machine. I'll go ahead and install Debian on it and I have a nice Nvidia card with lots of cores on it to install for all my Gnu/Linux programming needs. I'll keep the Win machine for my ViStudio programming and game playing. With WSL2 being hyper-v  it's just not worth it to wait for gpu pass-thru, and they still haven't got raw sockets working either."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/349496524-awokeknowing","datetime":"2019-08-28","body":"FYI y'all, Microsoft has no plans to do this for WSL. They think WSL 2 is the future and they will almost certainly do it there eventually. Meantime, they hope it will somehow become common for AI repos to work on regular windows.. looks like they will force Hyper-V. So it's unlikely they will achieve comparible GPU performance to native booted linux. So your repos will eventually work in a virtual machine (that can be pushed to Azure! haha) but nobody will really work that way since it will be slow. (but you can speed up in the cloud!! haha). Seems uservoice hit some deaf ears."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/913427248-yunbo-wang","datetime":"2019-08-04","body":"This is really needed as we are using intensivelly GPU for my work.
