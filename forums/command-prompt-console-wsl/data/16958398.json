They could be invoked with a special keyword like \"sudo\" - for example, writing \"sudo ssh root@my_server_ip\" on the Windows start menu would open the bash shell and connect to the respective server.

I think there is a CMD.EXE command that can sub-invoke lxrun, which starts bash or another Linux command.  If my understanding is correct, it would be very helpful for a WSL/Ubuntu/bash engineer to add this info to this request, and mark it as potentially fixed!"}]}
