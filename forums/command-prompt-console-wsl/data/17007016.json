I use Cygwin to build binaries I can call from a Matlab mex file.  I could use Visual Studio, but I'm much more comfortable with gcc and other Gnu/Linux development tools.  If there was some way to call directly into a Linux shared library, I would probably drop Cygwin.  Windows may become my new favorite OS.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/279213241-todd-goldfinger","datetime":"2016-11-08","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58070608-erkin-alp-g%C3%BCney","datetime":"2016-11-18","body":"This may result in frequent BSOD.
