Personally while I'm not entirely sure why someone would want to do this although I have seen a request in relation to ssh for it - I am sure it is handy in some way or other... (subshells - child processes??) it does make more sense to return to where you were (ie the parent bash window) when you close a \"sub\"shell... I guess maybe it will happen as as a part of being able to run windows commands from within lxss  (or WSL if you prefer) if that kind of interop gets implemented (I'm assuming it is already a goal)... but being that its calling bash itself may involve other tricks or traps??? note: bash.exe called from bash.exe is not the same as internally calling bash from bash","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/281353627-chris","datetime":"2016-11-11","comments":[]}
