I'm assuming this is because of some background magic in the way network traffic is handled. Is there any way for you guys to get in touch with AVG about this? I have to disable my firewall every time I want to pull any kind of file from anywhere.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/282710053-tex","datetime":"2016-11-14","comments":[]}
