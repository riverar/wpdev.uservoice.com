While ifconfig, ip, etc network support has been added and displays the wireless devices (wifi0, wifi1, ...), iwconfig and other tools cannot detect wireless support. Considering the omnipresence of wifi, this makes the \"Enable network connection enumeration\" request feel technically fulfilled but practically half-done. Can we expect wifi support in the near future? Or are there work arounds involving the installation or compilation of particular tools?","votes":"179","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/289686068-p-cas-sz","datetime":"2016-11-28","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/926320327","datetime":"2019-09-26","body":"It would be really helpful for pen testing a Wifi network especially because i have an old laptop that dosent support virtualization"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/916390243-piotr-trybisz","datetime":"2019-08-28","body":"I also want to use Kali Linux tools (like wifite) with my built-in wireless card."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/914055220-timothy-jee","datetime":"2019-08-09","body":"I want to use Kali in WSL for PenTesting as I am limited to Windows environment for work\n<br>Having wireless support would make Kali more functional in WSL"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/912827623-mathieu-berneau","datetime":"2019-07-30","body":"I'd like to use Hostapd on WSL"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/904708087-name","datetime":"2019-06-08","body":"Wsl is better off not created without full wifi adopter access.
