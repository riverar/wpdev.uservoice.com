There is no well-defined interface between modules and the kernel, which is why NVidia drivers etc. on Linux require recompiling the GPL shim for every new kernel installed by your distro (read: DKMS on Debian-based systems). Because of this there is no feasible way for Microsoft to provide compatibility between native Linux kernel modules and the WSL Kernel."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58070608-erkin-alp-g%C3%BCney","datetime":"2017-02-19","body":"WSL provides a bridge between Windows kernel and GNU/Linux userland.
