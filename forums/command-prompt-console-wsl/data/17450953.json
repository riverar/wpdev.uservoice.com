For example, this function is used by nginx to temporary write an HTTP uploaded file on the disk and right now i'm getting critical errors (= 500 http errors) from nginx (see full bug report). Would be great to add this feature in the future WSL versions!","votes":"15","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/297596737-antoine","datetime":"2016-12-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/742204987-ankit-kukreja","datetime":"2018-01-17","body":"Need to run nginx and lua and cannot do without this.
