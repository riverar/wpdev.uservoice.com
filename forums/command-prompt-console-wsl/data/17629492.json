These are important programming languages that one should be able to use from Bash. E.g. Maxima could output data that you want to feed into another program. It's also easier to install and maintain an updated version of the software via Aptitude/Apt than to go to some site and download an install package.","votes":"27","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158134188-mobluse","datetime":"2017-01-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/780072367-e-rr","datetime":"2018-04-23","body":"Clean install of Clisp in Ubuntu, with everything updated and upgraded gives this:"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/676034587-steve-hemingway","datetime":"2017-09-27","body":"I have this problem too."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/394176061","datetime":"2017-06-12","body":"k-LinuxNT@K-WIN10:~/Lisp$ clisp ilk.lsp/\n<br>/usr/lib/clisp-2.49/base/lisp.run: error while loading shared libraries: libavcall.so.0: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument\n<br>k-LinuxNT@K-WIN10:~/Lisp$ clisp\n<br>/usr/lib/clisp-2.49/base/lisp.run: error while loading shared libraries: libavcall.so.0: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument\n<br>k-LinuxNT@K-WIN10:~/Lisp$ sudo execstack -c /usr/lib/libavcall.so.0\n<br>sudo: unable to resolve host K-WIN7\n<br>k-LinuxNT@K-WIN10:~/Lisp$ clisp\n<br>/usr/lib/clisp-2.49/base/lisp.run: error while loading shared libraries: libcallback.so.0: cannot enable executable stack as shared object requires: Invalid argument"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/376244242-tim-daly","datetime":"2017-05-16","body":"apt-get install axiom\n<br>axiom\n<br>personality change failure 0"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158134188-mobluse","datetime":"2017-03-23","body":"$ maxima\n<br>personality failure 38"}]}
