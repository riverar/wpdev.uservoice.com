It would be useful to also lock the window height to the buffer height.\n<br>Also it would useful to not allow the user to resize the buffer, leaving it under the control of the application.\n<br>And the 'Wrap text output on resize' option needs to be accessible via a Win32 api call.","votes":"11","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/325213906-adam","datetime":"2017-02-06","comments":[]}
