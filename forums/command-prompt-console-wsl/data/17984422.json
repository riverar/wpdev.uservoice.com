It is one of my main issues with cygwin. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. Maybe some programm you are calling has some bugs or does not understand the unix or windows path format and you are never quite sure which one works.\n<br>Stay consistent. Stay with Ubuntu userland. Unix paths. Don't do some half baked compatibility layer in between that translates Windows paths."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/339648688-beach-dix","datetime":"2017-03-03","body":"A great example of this is msys.

If a windows path is given as an argument to any linux program, it should be able to find the path correctly. Even doing a \"cd\" to the Windows path should just work."}]}
