Add the Windows system32 directory ('/mnt/c/Windows/System32') to your WSL PATH, or just create a symlink such as '/bin/cmd' -&gt; '/mnt/c/Windows/System32/cmd.exe'), and run CMD commands using `cmd&lt;.exe&gt; /c &lt;command&gt;`\n<br>* Easy to setup, requires no WSL changes (beyond those already in Insider builds, at least), but not user-convenient.\n<br>2. Create either scripts (in WSL 'bin' folder) for Windows CMD builtins (they could run `cmd /c &lt;command&gt;` as above), or create bash functions (or aliases) that implement the Windows builtins, and place those aliases/functions in your '~/.bashrc' file\n<br>* Requires no changes to WSL, but needs a bit more setup on the user's part.\n<br>* \"Just works\" for most use cases, but won't work if you try to run a command that you haven't added an alias/function/script for.\n<br>3. Change the 'command_not_found_handle' function in bash (see <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/787424/hook-into-command-not-found-handler-in-ubuntu\">https://superuser.com/questions/787424/hook-into-command-not-found-handler-in-ubuntu</a>) to try invoking `/mnt/c/Windows/cmd.exe /c &lt;command&gt;`\n<br>* May actually be the least complicated / most functional option, but requires familiarity with that function (especially if you don't want to break things like the automatic package lookup for unknown commands).\n<br>* Requires no change to WSL (though it *could* be put in the default install).\n<br>4. Change the (Ubuntu) Linux version of bash that WSL ships with to do something that no other Linux shell does, or change WSL itself to \"pretend\" the relevant commands are actually present\n<br>* Big change to WSL, including a significant maintenance burden.\n<br>* Potentially breaks compatibility with other versions of bash for purposes of scripting, not to mention crash reports and so forth.\n<br>* Not helpful for those of us who'd really rather use, say, Powershell commands; cmd is on its (long overdue) way out."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/327309601-james","datetime":"2017-02-09","body":"To clarify, my suggestion entails being somehow able to type command prompt commands into the bash shell so that users don't have to switch between cp and bash"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/327327028-kostas-tsiampouris","datetime":"2017-02-08","body":"That would be really helpful"}]}
