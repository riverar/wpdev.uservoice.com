If the user changes the current console colors using the `color` command, that new color preference is unfortunately discarded when any of the reset sequences are encountered.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/332172418-roy-ivy-iii","datetime":"2017-02-15","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/332172418-roy-ivy-iii","datetime":"2017-02-28","body":"After investigating... when using either `color XX` or SetConsoleScreenBufferInfoEx() to set the text attributes, the color changes *are* propagated to the \"Colors\" tab of the console Properties dialog."}]}
