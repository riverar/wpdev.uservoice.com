They let you choose any font installed on Windows. The CMD and Bash on Windows just allow you to choose from a list of some very old monospace fonts. All terminals should allow full font customization so that we can decorate our terminals that we use all day long as well as take advantage of cool themes available on oh-my-zsh and others. The Solarized Terminal Colors and editor colors for VIM also is a great way to extend windows terminal and command experience","votes":"17","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/347930611-mr-doomsbuster","datetime":"2017-03-25","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/388403683-raimundo-martins","datetime":"2017-06-01","body":"Why not use another terminal emulator?
