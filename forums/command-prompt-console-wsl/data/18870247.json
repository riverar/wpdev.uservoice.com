Is that something we can expect to be implemented any time soon? Perhaps, not by implementing a Linux kernel, but by having Windows kernel work with Linux kernel headers?","votes":"25","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/354920689","datetime":"2017-04-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/876920053","datetime":"2018-12-25","body":"Support for linux-tools/perf is important for micro-benchmarking in JVM languages through the Java Microbenchmarking Harness (<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)\">http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)</a>.
