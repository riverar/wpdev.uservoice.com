E.g. that's why MESA builds for Windows using mingw-w64 are made on Linux and failed on Windows (see <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&amp;id=94072\">https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?format=multiple&amp;id=94072</a> ).\n<br>Would be nice to increase this limitation, so won't be needed to use Linux for tasks, which could be performed on Windows.","votes":"12","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/358399465-alexander","datetime":"2017-04-15","comments":[]}
