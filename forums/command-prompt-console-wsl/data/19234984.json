Right now, running `fdisk -l` outputs \"cannot open /proc/partitions\" and doing something like `dd if=G: of=disk.img` outputs \"dd: failed to open ‘G:’: No such file or directory\". I do not see anything in /dev/ that seems to indicate anything is mapped to drives in Windows.","votes":"56","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/98275998-timothy-zorn","datetime":"2017-05-10","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/789688615-jules-%C3%B6rn","datetime":"2018-05-21","body":"I would like to mount a native linux disk attached to my computer,\n<br>That is why fdisk/mount is important to me."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58070608-erkin-alp-g%C3%BCney","datetime":"2018-02-24","body":"Only one OS personality (WSL is one) can be allowed to access the disk directly at a time due to security constraints.

Coupled with actual mount capabilities (linux filesystems), this could be used as a quick access to another partition's linux installation. I don't think it'll ever be possible to leave dual-boot, but at least this way I'd do quick tasks without leaving windows and without spending 2x the needed space for linux"}]}
