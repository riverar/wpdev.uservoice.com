Specifically, I want to be able to mount partitions on my hard drive that I have windows installed on.","votes":"189","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/418022662-brady","datetime":"2017-07-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/891066079-sam-sammandam","datetime":"2019-04-14","body":"See my request to work with Crossmeta below. It provides all VFS syscalls with XFS, EXT4 support and FUSE to support various other file systems. It also has losetup for loopback images. Currently WSL can interface with crossmeta driver but it is silly to have all the VFS translation when there is already POSIX file system to serve directly."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/881228692-ndrewxie","datetime":"2019-01-23","body":"This is a great idea. However, accessing raw disk requires admin privileges - hopefully the devs make WSL open the UAC prompt when those features are actually used (and avoid using those features, too), not on startup - because there ARE many standard users out here!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/778775683-gregory-young","datetime":"2018-04-19","body":"At the very least, please implement loop devices so we can mount .iso images in WSL. As it stands, I cannot do any linux .iso manipulation and rebuilding in WSL."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/680877757-wineunuuchs2unix","datetime":"2017-11-06","body":"When I askied a similar question in AskUbuntu.com it appears the better way is to have Linux store your scripts, documents, etc. you want shared with WSL on an NTFS partition which Linux can write to. The other option is even uglier having to setup a second machine as a Open-SSH server and storing your scripts and documents there so they can be accessed from your dual-booted laptop. I looked at Paragon (they charge for it) and Ext2FSD but it clobbers stuff in 64-bit mode (version .68 or .69 IIRC). There is WinBTRFS but that is still one-man experimental project and I don't feel like using BTRFS in Linux. +1 for your request and I'd appreciate comments of a better way of sharing the same file on a dual-boot laptop between Windows 10 WSL and Ubuntu16.04."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/214016271-harry-gindi","datetime":"2017-09-03","body":"Raw disk mounting is possible."}]}
