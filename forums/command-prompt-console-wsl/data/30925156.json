Currently WSL supports a limited one way permission mapping from Windows ACL's to POSIX permissions but it needs to be 2-way. Many basic tasks like using ssh keys or working with git repos require being able to set file permissions. It doesn't even matter that much to which exactly windows ACL certain permissions map as long as they are consistent (e.g. setting perms with chmod and then getting them with stat should result in exact same perms).","votes":"48","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/159323322-roman-semenov","datetime":"2017-08-20","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/822660280-john-summerfield","datetime":"2018-07-11","body":"I have a different perspective. I have transferred a 2Tb disk of photos from one computer to another. I have tried and tried various incantations of takeown and icalcs with little success.

One part of this would be to make chmod do something sensible on NTFS files.  Another would be to map NTFS owners to something besides \"root\" in WSL.  I understand it's a hard problem, but this really would make bash more of a replacement for Cygwin, MSYS2, Hamilton C Shell, and other unix-y command lines that were previously available in Windows.  Honestly, just changing the default color scheme in bash so that the files in NTFS volumes aren't highlighted in green would be a step in the right direction.

Unfortunately, without basic chmod capabilities, that will not happen.\n<br>Please consider offering support for chmod in the future.  Until then, WSL is of very limited value to me."}]}
