Perhaps having SELinux added to the Windows Store would help solve this issue as well due to it's very nature. Supporting the full functionality of that Linux distro should provide support within WSL itself for all Linux distros to properly secure it as you would any other normal Linux box."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/437191351-lewis-donofrio","datetime":"2017-09-18","body":"Perhaps find out another way to mitigate this.  For me this is a non-issue because I never run as admin only my normal account, others might not know to remove themselves from the administrator group."}]}
