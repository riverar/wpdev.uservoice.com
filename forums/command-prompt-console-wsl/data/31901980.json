I need to redudntly install stuff if I use an IDEA (like intellij or eclipse). To expose git to these tools. I can try to be creative with bat scripts to expose some of the bash native git. But then there is achance to get a \"Cannot launch bash because another instance is running un-elevated.  Elevated and un-elevated instances are not permitted to run simultaneously.\" response (and break your bat script).","votes":"33","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/686467033-martijn-cremer","datetime":"2017-10-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/876920053","datetime":"2018-12-25","body":"In Intellij IDEA you can actually configure the \"terminal\" tool to use the WSL bash (running one right now with Ubuntu 16.04).

The only thing the any app developer can do is figure out a workaround. Workaround isn't a fix. if there isn't a github issue created for this, I suggest creating one. If there is (I believe I've seen several dupes, list this Uservoice in the one not marked as duplicate)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/701313952-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BC-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9","datetime":"2017-10-28","body":"There is also related ticket for IntelliJ guys: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-29474\">https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WEB-29474</a>"}]}
