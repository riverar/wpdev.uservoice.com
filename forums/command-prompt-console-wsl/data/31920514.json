Creating these test packages requires access to some file servers in order to copy needed files, a few of which are executable.  Using WSL would very nearly allow me to get rid of my Linux desktop, except it can't distinguish files on the server that have the execute permission set from those that don't.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/690500359-samuel-figueroa","datetime":"2017-10-17","comments":[]}
