After changing the config file to allow all upgrades available in developmental release after upgrading to FSU, I now am unable to perform the upgrade to 16.10 and higher. I would like to see support to have the ability to upgrade to the latest versions available so that we won't have to download the development build and place it in a VM or Docker container for testing purposes.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/695281537-wsluser","datetime":"2017-10-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/695281537-wsluser","datetime":"2017-11-16","body":"Edit, meant to say apt-get upgrade, not update"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/695281537-wsluser","datetime":"2017-11-16","body":"I managed to upgrade to 17.10 Artful but there are bugs with apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade that make them fail due to the bash .deb. There are several Github tickets by other users that involve this User Voice request. A *potential* workaround would be <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2618\">https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/2618</a> for easier installation and less corruption of data. For the sake of the concept though, I would still maintain that better support should be defined so that workarounds aren't needed. I would also relate this request to the request for multiple versions of distros to be available in the Windows Store."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/437191351-lewis-donofrio","datetime":"2017-10-31","body":"I just update sources.list replacing and adding zesty the upgrade/dist-upgrade (<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://1drv.ms/p/s!AsBlZbBf72iNnZoZn0eLi-ywKYEerg\">https://1drv.ms/p/s!AsBlZbBf72iNnZoZn0eLi-ywKYEerg</a> - outlined in slide 9)"}]}
