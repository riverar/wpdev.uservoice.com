My request is just an extension of that to include ALL WSL fixes (current and future) to be backported to FCU until the next stable release. It makes no sense for organizations that need the fixes to continue developing but can't use Insider builds to just be forced to put projects on hold or harder simply because Microsoft only keeps the fixes to the latest Insider build only. If WSL is truly considered no longer beta and is getting full support then that means including all new fixes being backported. Otherwise this is NOT full support for companies and users for WSL and Microsoft should update their blog to state there is *limited* support.
