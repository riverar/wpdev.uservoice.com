I am so in love with it, I went ahead and created multiple .NET Core applications, including MVC web apps in Linux. Now what I am missing is support for Native SQL Server database in WSL. I want to use the WSL as a self contained Dev environment for .NET Core development in Linux without bothering about having another Linux VM or so. \n<br>Please add this feature so that we could at-least install SQL server developer edition in WSL and can build great data driven apps.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/726127822-subhankar-sarkar","datetime":"2017-12-14","comments":[]}
