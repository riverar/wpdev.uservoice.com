It is possible to map Posix ACLs to Windows ACLs with some limitations. That would greatly enhance interoperability between windows applications and wsl applications. Using metadata to save posix permissions on drvfs mounts greatly reduces interoperability, since windows applications are not aware of posix permissions saved as metadata.","votes":"27","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251297848-nkef","datetime":"2017-12-20","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/777139966-agowa-awoga","datetime":"2018-04-14","body":"Can't wait for this to become available.

Suffice to say, with 17093, this is mostly completed. What's left is the implementation of Ancillary data such as  (`SCM_RIGHTS`) and (â€˜SCM_CREDENTIALS`) on AF_Unix for Windows.
