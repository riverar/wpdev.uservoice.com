We have wsl.exe now as well as better piping and interop syntax. Upgrade to the latest Insiders, read up on the changes including tutorials for using the new features and then see if this has been answered for you. I think what you're looking for has probably been answered even if not quite the way you expected."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/728889742-niko-pasanen","datetime":"2017-12-21","body":"Yet another way to implement this would be to use syntax where '|' would mean to pipe inside Windows (when calling from cmd or powershell) and '|&gt;' (or something else) would mean that piping is intended to go to the \"another\" OS (e.g.Ubuntu). This would make perhaps even cleaner syntax:"}]}
