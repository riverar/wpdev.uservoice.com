Linux is open-source, therefore Android is open-source. Google wants to move away from that?

Go ahead, don't install an X server such as Xming or VcxSrv, try to run a x11 app \"natively\". It will fail every time.Want to use Wayland? Forget it, even with VcxSrv, Wayland won't work and has a Github issue associated because of it. Anyways, this isn't related to the Ask. I mentioned about GUI because you need GPU support to run your smart phone apps. Unless you found a way to run it inside the console while displaying everything that will be displayed to your customers (I have serious doubts about that), this won't be looked at. Interesting to note though is the fact that apparently there is some code about android graphic support based on WSL's roots: ADSS for Windows Phone. So some code is there but disabled that would support this ask. Problem is there isn't enough prioritization for this (needs much more votes) I personally would love it if we could run our Android (and Apple) apps from Windows just as a user of Windows and Android. Google and Apple could make more profit then too, some of which would go to MS, for users of WSL by adding their Google Play Store and Apple Store respectively in Windows similar to the Windows Store app."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/437191351-lewis-donofrio","datetime":"2018-01-23","body":"I have to beg to differ on that WSLUser.

This is a rather buggy approach though not nearly as buggy as it was in the beginning. Doing this is the top of of the UserVoice list, vote for it. Being able to run Android apps from Windows would be great but then there quite a few complications for that, one of which I just spoke about."}]}
