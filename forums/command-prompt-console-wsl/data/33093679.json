For me specifically, it's being able to utilize dev tools such as VSCode, Sublime Text, Draft, Javalin, Bootsnap, OSQuery, and/or FSQL without downloading a third party X server that only does partial implementation. Libgl is specifically required to get GUI apps to run and doesn't currently exist. Please implement libgl and create an API for driver makers to use to enable use of these and other GUI dev tools.

Libgl is there because it is of course installed with the distro but is unimplemented in the sense that there's no way to use it with the underlying hardware and only software-rendering via XMING or VcxSrv is achievable because of course opengl is already in linux space."}]}
