Sometimes I will has 7 or 8 tabs open at once... Adding tabs to the command terminal would be an excellent upgrade.  I work with a bunch of DevOps and TechOps people and the vast majority would rather be using windows, but because of the lack of features with the command box they are stuck using MAC's","votes":"72","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/752888593","datetime":"2018-02-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37066586-tluangtea","datetime":"2019-04-15","body":"Ubuntu terminal is so amazing because of this.

I use tmux tabs, and navigate through them using CTRL+NUM and works better than any terminal emulator's. Mouse click also works, and tabs can be displayed explicitly. Furthermore using tmux removes dependencies on specific terminal emulators. Totally recommend trying a setup of tmux."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880563310-mathieu-caroff","datetime":"2019-01-18","body":"Some crazy people run some X servers (VcXsrv or Xming), then start Linux terminals directly on Windows:\n<br>```\n<br>C:\\Windows\\System32\\bash.exe -c \"(nohup env DISPLAY=:0 SHLVL=0 sakura &amp;&gt;/dev/null) &amp; sleep .1\"\n<br>```"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/341358172-abhishek-bhasker","datetime":"2018-07-26","body":"Install SSH Service on WSL and then use ssh to login through putty type terminal."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/294528070-robin-munn","datetime":"2018-07-18","body":"This may be a duplicate of <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908-command-prompt-console-windows-subsystem-for-l/suggestions/6509358-windows-console-should-support-tabbed-pages\">https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/266908-command-prompt-console-windows-subsystem-for-l/suggestions/6509358-windows-console-should-support-tabbed-pages</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/815865403-paul-stelian-olaru","datetime":"2018-06-18","body":"Tabs can be opened in Gnome-Terminal (you can use a third party X server for now to run it) or similar programs (Gnome-Terminal is sometimes quirky, especially the initial configuration)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/791054329-jack","datetime":"2018-05-26","body":"use byobu"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/230939667","datetime":"2018-05-22","body":"tabs, tabs management (memorize a set of tabs, with path etc, like with timeline), and window splits (like in VS) would be neat !!!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/775394725","datetime":"2018-04-09","body":"my 50 cents.. go *full in* and take your time to get used to \"tmux\"."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/762318304","datetime":"2018-03-02","body":"Ever tried conemu?
