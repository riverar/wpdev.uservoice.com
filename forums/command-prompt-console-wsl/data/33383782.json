Anything you do in Linux, you should be able to do in WSL. If it's not capable yet, then vote on an existing UserVoice. If there's something specific that might be more of a bug or extremely technical such as an issue with SO_TIMESTAMP, file an issue on <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL\">https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL</a>. FYI, there is a new issue created for SO_TIMESTAMP. Similarly there are dozens of issues regarding /proc which the WSL team is working on. "}]}
