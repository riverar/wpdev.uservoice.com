I've tried using virtual machines, but that tends to not be feasibly in some projects.","votes":"98","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/767927911","datetime":"2018-03-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/787549393-marco-devin","datetime":"2018-05-16","body":"The number of bits in a processor refers to the size of the data types that it handles and the size of its registry. A 64-bit processor is capable of storing more computational values, including memory addresses, which means it's able to access over four billion times as much physical memory than a 32-bit processor."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/695281537-wsluser","datetime":"2018-04-13","body":"This ask already exists.
