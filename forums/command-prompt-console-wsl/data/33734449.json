Something like that for text based applications running in WSL. So if I wanted to download packages in a seperate window, I could run something like \"start sudo apt get upgrade\" straight from WSL. Also, an option to auto-terminate the window would be great.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/769906738-jonathan-archer","datetime":"2018-03-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/789728857-hayden","datetime":"2018-05-21","body":"In the mean time I would suggest trying a WSL-compatible terminal with hotkeys to open new windows."}]}
