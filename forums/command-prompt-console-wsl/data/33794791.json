While it is easy to just NTFS-compress the files in Windows proper, WSL files need to be hunted down and compressed, all in an \"unsafe\" manner. Windows should provide an interface in WSL to transparently compress files with NTFS facilities.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251123767-mingye-wang-arthur2e5","datetime":"2018-03-29","comments":[]}
