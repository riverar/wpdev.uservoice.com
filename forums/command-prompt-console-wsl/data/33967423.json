Go to C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\Appdata\\Local\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu18.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc (although the part starting from the underscore after onWindows may be different on different PCs) and backup that directory with your favorite method. I've seen people do it with a backup program and I've seen using 7-Zip to backup/compress the whole thing. Make sure you get that directory and all the sub-directories as one has the rootfs in it and another has all the permissions for the rootfs (I think in one of the localstate dirs... best to just back it *all* up). To restore just put it all back to the same place."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/872185819","datetime":"2018-11-22","body":"I productively use the WSL (ssh, building, ...).

This would make running/resetting it so much easier, and possibly make it a good way to get a env up and running fast."}]}
