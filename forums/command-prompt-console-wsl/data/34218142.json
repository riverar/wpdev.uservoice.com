In much cases this is an SSD with less space than a second drive like a normal hdd with much more space. If you use wsl for development of a Website or try to use WSL with an x-server for windows much space is needed to take advantage of it. So there should be an option to move the wsl and all files containing to a drive where an user has much more space than on it's system drive by default.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/786161860-joachim-namyslo","datetime":"2018-05-11","comments":[]}
