It can only change colors of cmd and Powershell but not of WSL or other console programs.\n<br>The color tool should be integrated with the console properties so that we can easily change colors of WSL or any other console programs.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/305739850-huang-zhaoquan","datetime":"2018-05-11","comments":[]}
