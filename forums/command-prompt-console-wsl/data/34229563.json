If it was possible to set and get Unix file attributes from Windows, it would make interop easier. This would be similar in spirit to the AF_UNIX socket support that was recently introduced.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/786499750-david-windehem","datetime":"2018-05-12","comments":[]}
