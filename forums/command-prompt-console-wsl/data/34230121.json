However, what is lacking in Win32 is a function that takes a (possibly) escaped UNICODE path and converts it to the UTF8 sequence that a WSL process sees, and back again. For example, a git repo with files containing characters that are unsupported in Windows (not too uncommon) will only be possible to work with in WSL - Git for Windows will see the WSL paths as deleted, and instead replaced by their escaped UNICODE counterparts. A supported API would make it possible to make more robust ports of Linux tools, such as Git, to Windows.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/786499750-david-windehem","datetime":"2018-05-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/789728857-hayden","datetime":"2018-05-21","body":"Would this be useful for your issue in the mean time? <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/laurent22/wslpath\">https://github.com/laurent22/wslpath</a>"}]}
