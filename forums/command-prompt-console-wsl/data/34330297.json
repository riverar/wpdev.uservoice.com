E.g., in Python calling `sys.platform` just returns `linux`, not `linux-wsl` or something like this. It'd be helpful if there were a command line argument that could reliably confirm that the platform is WSL.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/423387883-chris-h","datetime":"2018-05-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/866723944-dana-myers","datetime":"2018-11-05","body":"Perhaps naively, I'd ask what the use case(s) is for this; in other words, what will an application do with the knowledge? Having a single 'flag' like this leads applications to infer perhaps a large set of assumptions - assumptions that may not remain valid under newer builds of WSL. If specific features are involved, then specific flags would be much better.\n"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/819666655-pavel-a","datetime":"2018-07-02","body":"To check if you are running on WSL:"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/816441337-paul-marquess","datetime":"2018-06-20","body":"Agree that we need an official way to know that your code is running in WSL."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/792134995-cam","datetime":"2018-05-29","body":"This seems to be a good place to start...\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38086185/how-to-check-if-a-program-is-run-in-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-and-not-just-plain\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38086185/how-to-check-if-a-program-is-run-in-bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-and-not-just-plain</a>"}]}
