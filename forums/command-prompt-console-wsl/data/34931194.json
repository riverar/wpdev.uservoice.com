I installed ubuntu18.04 on the administrator account.  There does not seem to be any way for the personal account to access the administrators ubuntu.  (1) is it possible; (2) if not, can it be made so; (3) if it cannot, this would probably be a good idea (multiple account access to a single installation).  If you think about it, this is the way \"real\" linux installations are.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/827268478","datetime":"2018-07-25","comments":[]}
