The thread on GitHub suggests that users suffering from this problem should complain to the software vendors and ask them to recompile their sources with more recent compilers. But this is an unhelpful position to take as it merely means users will be more inclined to install native Linux rather than WSL. WSL will consequently be seen as not quite on par with native Linux."}]}
