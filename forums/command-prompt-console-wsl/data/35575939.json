I understand that'll take some process ID juggling, but I think it's doable.  If I'm in a bash shell and I do a \"ps auxww\" I'd love to see *every* process running on the box, not just what's in WSL.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/854102263-jason-van-patten","datetime":"2018-09-29","comments":[]}
