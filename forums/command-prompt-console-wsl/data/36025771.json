(which is not easy at all)\n<br>What I was able to do so far: install Opensuse Leap and upgrade it to Tumbleweed.\n<br>What I could immagine should work aswell easy enough: change similar distros (rpm / deb)\n<br>There are tutorials on how to install opensuse in old WSL which only provided Ubuntu. Maybe you can use it.\n<br>Thus this seems a rather \"nice to have\" improvement."}]}
