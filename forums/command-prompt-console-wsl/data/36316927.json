Practically every feature could. NT kernel supports USB and other hardware clearly, and the syscall translation layer relies on the NT kernel. A lot of stuff is stubbed or faked to make the user space think it's Linux. In other cases, the sys calls themselves are implemented. Needless to say though, this issue is moot. Mostly because you actually got what you asked for: WSL2 and with it Windows officially ships a Linux kernel. So now all you have to do is wait for it to release. But it does come at the cost of being a Hyper-V VM though a lightweight one (not entirely sure how that works and the devs have yet to fully explain the implementation details there but the NT kernel already uses it interestingly enough.)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/899768377","datetime":"2019-05-10","body":"@WSLUser,\n<br>looked up linux to make nmap work, linux says use libusb, libusb refuses to work on WSL. Looked at libusb source, attempted to make changes to get it to work on WSL, couldn't do it as it requires syscalls to kernel for raw sockets. So don't me we don't need revisions to WSL/Kernel interface to something more like a full kernel."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/878263330-tiger-wang","datetime":"2019-04-11","body":"\"If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\""},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/695281537-wsluser","datetime":"2019-02-19","body":"Look a troll. We actually don't need a full Linux kernel. If you want it, use Hyper-V or some other VM solution. The features requested don't require and shouldn't require a Linux kernel. When you research how-to guides, forget the word wsl and look up with \"linux\" you'll find it works far more often than not. The only real issue is there's no systemd so certain things like systemctl don't work. That doesn't require the Linux kernel either. Next time, do something more productive like submit bug requests instead of drawing negative attention to yourself."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/884548417-tony","datetime":"2019-02-16","body":"I understand this feeling...
