Since even Windows 98 I accidentally type 'ls' in cmd and all I got is \"'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file\". Why don't we bring some basic unix commands in cmd like in PowerShell?","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/761822407-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B0-%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2","datetime":"2019-04-29","comments":[]}
