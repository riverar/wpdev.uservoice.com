I use SecureCRT from VanDyke that allows:\n<br>1. running a linux command such as `sz /etc/hosts` that drops the requested file(s) into a configurable local folder (e.g the windows desktop).\n<br>2. drag'n'drop one or more files onto the terminal window invokes the `rz` linux command which receives the dropped files into the current linux folder (non-destructively) with their correct filenames.\n<br>This highly useful functionality can be used within nested SSH sessions to pull/push arbitrary files between local windows folders and remote linux machines.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/900569152-martin-meadows","datetime":"2019-05-15","comments":[]}
