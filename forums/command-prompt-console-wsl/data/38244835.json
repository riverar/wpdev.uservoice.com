I.E. Airmon-ng on a wireless interface, or even say Ettercap-Bettercap arp poisoning on Networks. I’m more specific on towards Kali Linux OS wireless tools but this is more in general like as a whole I believe could benefit if it was an option to have Non-Bridged Direct Network Adapter passthrough I’m not sure if it’s possible to really even have it emulate wifi0 or this whatever to wlan0 in the WSL container, but if it’s possible it would be great to have that and passthrough I dunno to maybe the windows driver and execute arp poisoning or being able to use Aircrack-ng full suite of tools","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/912461548-isa-rahmany","datetime":"2019-07-27","comments":[]}
