However, I've been seeking for a way for the cmd window to have a tabbed interface for a while. So, for example, I can run a ping/tracert etc. in one tab, a chkdsk in another tab, and something else in a third, without having multiple windows open taking up screen real estate.","votes":"1,660","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57617616-shaun","datetime":"2014-10-01","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/753309160-m-piszczek","datetime":"2019-09-27","body":"The features in Windows Terminal seem very promising but after less than an hour of use it became unresponsive three times (running windows Terminal commands) and crashed twice exiting unexpectedly (connected to a Linux server with ssh).

Hey i'm a windows guy but for Techops/Devops there is no comparison with regards to the terminal. Microsoft for years has fell way behind in this area.  it actually should be a bit embarrassing for Microsoft.  Kudo's for getting WSL but it still falls short from a mac or linux terminal.  Really need tabs in my Linux WSL environment.

I use the solarized color scheme for everything, including my terminal, but if Windows made their own terminal, I would have to write yet another script to setup the solarized color scheme in yet another terminal - and I don't think I feel like doing that!
