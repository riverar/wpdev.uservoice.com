Just found it today and set it to on before writing this.

I like it, and am adding it to the backlog.

As for your first point, it sounds like you misread my suggestion and have reversed my meaning. Doesn't sound so silly to me..."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57618290-anonymous","datetime":"2014-10-01","body":"If it was just the chrome surrounding the window, the text would have a highly visible box around the outside of the dimmed console. This is significantly worse than dimming the whole window and would look crappy from a design point of view. Secondly the transparency feature is completely based on taste, so adding a percentage value is counterproductive. Nobody needs exactly 70%. They need enough to make it look good to their individual taste. So I think that's somewhat of a silly suggestion."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57272488-microsoft-console-team","datetime":"2014-10-01","body":"Yes, you're right again. :) -- We are thinking the same thing, and would have even liked to get both of these into the technical preview. Time was against us and we (well I, blame me) decided that *some* transparency was better than none for now. And again, the all too familiar disclaimer: we can't commit to including any feature or change, including these. --Rich"}]}
