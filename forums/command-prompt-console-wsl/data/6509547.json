This popped out at me right away in the W10 preview. Even though it's technically the same padding as win 8.1 the last of window chome really makes it look odd. A nice 5x margin would help."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57622441-keith-hill","datetime":"2014-10-01","body":"I didn't get this request until I finally got Windows 10 installed and saw that they went to freakin' one pixel wide Window chrome.  Yeah, there needs to be some interior padding if they stick with such narrow chrome.  Otherwise, the console just doesn't look right.

We are tracking this item and agree it can be better. We're waiting to see how some shell functionality / API's land before we take a harder look at getting this changed. --Rich"}]}
