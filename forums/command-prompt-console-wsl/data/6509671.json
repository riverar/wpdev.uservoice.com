Maybe you want SHIFT-CONTROL-@ to increase the font size, for example. This technical preview build hard codes all editing and action keys. If one of our choices conflicts with another app or assignment you've specific, go to the \"Experimental Options tab\" and disable the extended editing keys.","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57272488-microsoft-console-team","datetime":"2014-10-01","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57622441-keith-hill","datetime":"2014-10-01","body":"What I would like to see is an extension point that include custom key mappings but also bindings to custom functions like what PSReadline does today with PowerShell. At the very least, you should provide whatever hooks are needed by utilities like to PSReadline to further enhance the line-editing and command history experience.  FWIW PSReadline is an open source project on GitHub that was created by a Microsoftie working on the PowerShell team."}]}
