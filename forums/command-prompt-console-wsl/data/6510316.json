But for me, I like to have as much content on one screen as possible. So usually what I like to do is have on monitor with one window on full screen and have multiple consoles within the same window. That way I don't have to switch between tabs...","votes":"143","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57627263-cesar-hernandez","datetime":"2014-10-01","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/287772287-adam-russell","datetime":"2016-11-24","body":"\"Delivered in Win10AU\""},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57627263-cesar-hernandez","datetime":"2016-08-11","body":"Well that's ****!

The second I've added to."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57620575-bitcrazed","datetime":"2015-04-20","body":"ConEmu does a pretty good job of this, but I think with some additional UXP polish, a multi-pane console window would be an AWESOME new addition to Win10."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/69835678-mo","datetime":"2015-04-02","body":"One of my favorite tools for this kind of functionality in *nix was screen. The ability to attach and detach from running console sessions as well as multiplex visually, if you choose, and also share with others connected to the same machine was fantastic and very useful. Bringing in screen like functionality to the windows console would be fantastic."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57983773-albert","datetime":"2014-10-08","body":"Check other users' ideas about tabbed console and \"terminal multiplexer\":"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57983773-albert","datetime":"2014-10-08","body":"If added, this should be done together with the tabbed option (see another user idea in this list), because it's just a matter of making conhost.exe using either a tab window control (tabbed view) or spliter controls."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57804446-marx","datetime":"2014-10-06","body":"This will be awesome!
