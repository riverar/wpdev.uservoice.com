When clicking a file name or holding ctrl, alt or shift and clicking the file name I'd love it if it filled the name in at the cursor immediately. That way I can work quickly with large weirdly named file names without having to copy/paste the file name itself.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57632519-jason-zsiba","datetime":"2014-10-01","comments":[]}
