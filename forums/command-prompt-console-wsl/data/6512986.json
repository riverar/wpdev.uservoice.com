This behavior is present in both CMD and PowerShell windows, but does not appear to be in other applications I checked to verify if this was a conhost problem or a broader Win10 bug. Grabbing the north, northeast, southwest, west, and northwest edges of the window and dragging to resize will show this behavior. Grabbing other edges will resize the window correctly, i.e., the opposite edge remains anchored in its position so the window does not move along with the resizing operation.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57617616-shaun","datetime":"2014-10-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/65808101-anonymous","datetime":"2015-02-24","body":"This occurs when using shortcut key to move the cmd window around the screen. When you use the Windows Key + arrows to move the console around such as snapping it into corners, the text in the console gets moved out of the current view as the focus moves to the top or bottom of the buffer."}]}
