Allow to run programs so that I can keep on using the CMD window.

There's no built-in facility for checking the state of the \"job\" or to get its output (other than to Wait which is blocking).  Start seems more like a \"fire-and-forget\" mechanism.  It also doesn't support running jobs on other computers which is something admins need."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57775552-travis-c-howard","datetime":"2014-10-04","body":"The \"start\" command already does this. Just run \"start /?\" to see what it offers. You'll see that you can drop immediately back to a prompt without the command finishing first, or open windows in minimized mode."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57622441-keith-hill","datetime":"2014-10-02","body":"PowerShell already supports background jobs.  Why bother adding this to CMD which has so many other fundamental limitations?"}]}
