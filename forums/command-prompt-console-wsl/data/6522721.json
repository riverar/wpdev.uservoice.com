To disable a network adapter, for example, you can run \"sudo ifconfig eth0 down\". The prefixed \"sudo\" command will run \"ifconfig eth0 down\" with what is essentially administrator privileges in Windows. Currently you have to do some long-winded (long-typed?) \"runas\", which requires that a username and password are provided. I don't necessarily need Command Prompt to always run as administrator, I just need SOME of the commands I to run as administrator.","votes":"274","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57775552-travis-c-howard","datetime":"2014-10-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/670568848-andrew","datetime":"2017-09-17","body":"Sudo for Windows (sudowin) has been around for a L-O-O-O-G time and works very nicely."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18788661-simpson-bart","datetime":"2015-08-12","body":"I've used elevate.exe for quite a while."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/79851858-dave","datetime":"2015-06-06","body":"seems pointless to me.
