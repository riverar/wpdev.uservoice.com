Just because we have 64bit megamachines doesn't mean we want 16bit emulated code eschewed into an add-on runtime (dosbox or hardware-virtualisation) which doesn't really do anything to allow interoperation of hosted programmes. &lt;/Pie-In-The-Sky&gt;"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57983773-albert","datetime":"2014-10-11","body":"EDIT: After double-checking, I saw that the \"bug concerning mapping the created screenbuffer into the client address space\" was fixed in Windows 8+, so that it only exists in Windows 7 (it would need a dedicated MS patch). However in Windows 7 and Windows 8+ there is still this NtVdmControl call. I personally think this check is totally useless (that verifies whether the caller is a VDM process or not), because from my point-of-view, since conhost.exe runs with the same rights as the client console app, there is no way (normally) to possibly make the whole system crash by exploiting some vulnerability in the console graphics screenbuffers, contrary to what might was possible in Windows &lt;= Vista when the console subsystem was hosted in winsrv.dll/csrss.exe ..."}]}
