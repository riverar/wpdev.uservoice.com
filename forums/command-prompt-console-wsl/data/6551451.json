Even some basic find support would be nice.  I've used less394 and like it.  It might be a bit too powerful but something along those lines would be a massive improvement over more.com.","votes":"15","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57622441-keith-hill","datetime":"2014-10-11","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/825720652-todd-d-leonhardt","datetime":"2018-07-20","body":"GNU less is an awesome and beloved tool which is widely used on macOS/Linux/POSIX:\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html\">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html</a>\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/less/\">https://www.gnu.org/software/less/</a>"}]}
