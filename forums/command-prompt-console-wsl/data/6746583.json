The new command prompt DOES NOT HONOR MOUSE CLICKS.  Run the EDIT program that comes with Windows 10 32 bit and then try to pull the menus down with a mouse.  It doesn't work!!!  There are still apps that run in a Console Mode Window that need mouse support.  This needs to be fixed or I'll be recommending to my 800+ customer base to skip Windows 10!","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60298781","datetime":"2014-11-20","comments":[]}
