But for other inactive windows, allowing some transparency so they can bleed through is very attractive.  Couple this with an option to keep console windows on top (+transparent when inactive) and you get a really swell opportunity for console activities to be readily available without hogging screen space.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/77720895-jimmy-lewis","datetime":"2015-05-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/90686359-lukasz","datetime":"2015-07-28","body":"Transparency needs to be fixed as well. The background of the text area should be transparent not the entire window including the text. It makes the text hard to read. If you just make the text background area transparent the effect will be nice and subtle."}]}
