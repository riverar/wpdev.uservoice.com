Make the \"hit zone\"  for showing the scrollbar bigger than the scrollbar itself so it's not too hard to show.

I dislike \"scrubbing\" over applications to see if they have a scrollbar I can use. I also like to glance at the scrollbar's thumb to determine where I am in the display and how much content is before and after my position. It must be visible at all times for that to be possible."}]}
