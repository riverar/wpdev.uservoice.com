The JSON pages array is completely gone, and each request in the entries array is missing the pageref parameter. Not sure why this is missing since it is part of the HAR spec. It is even included in IE 11's network recordings that use an XML format, as well as every other browser that supports exporting HAR recordings using JSON format.\n<br>I would appreciate it if this could get fixed so the Edge HAR files follow the HAR spec.","votes":"43","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/107847696-michael-dunagan","datetime":"2015-10-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/110453652-michael-dunagan","datetime":"2016-02-15","body":"I'm not sure if this issue has gotten any attention.
