I don't have infinite room on my hard drive, and I much prefer the 2-3 GB machine rather than the 10+ GB Vista machine.  I definitely don't use XP any more for everyday use, but for testing IE its still a fine, fast OS.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/109731300-stephen-rider","datetime":"2015-10-09","comments":[]}
