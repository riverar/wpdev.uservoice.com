I get random screen freezing (monitor freezes, and I have to change display settings-if it's not my primary screen or reboot to get it working again). As well, the new Skype For Business screen sharing has caching issues if you aren't in a conference (just doing peer to peer with VBSS) if I have been using Edge.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/121953270-ryan-mccarney","datetime":"2015-11-13","comments":[]}
