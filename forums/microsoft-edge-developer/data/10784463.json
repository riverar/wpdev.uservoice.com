And the lack of isolation is not an edge-case problem (see worked examples at <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/inline-bidi-markup/index.en#staticexamples)\">http://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/inline-bidi-markup/index.en#staticexamples)</a>. It's hard to understand why Edge still doesn't support isolation for any use of the dir attribute and for bdi per the HTML standard. Unfortunately, the best recommendation for users of RTL scripts around the world is currently to use another browser than Edge."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/13098112-licantrop0","datetime":"2017-11-15","body":"Edge and IE are the only one not supporting this: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/the-dir-attribute-auto\">https://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/the-dir-attribute-auto</a>"}]}
