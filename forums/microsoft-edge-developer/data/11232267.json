When I test Microsoft Edge, I find the \"Request.Browser.Browser\" from Microsoft Edge was recognized as \"Chrome\".\n<br>I have to distinguish different kinds of browsers for decoding reason. Now I can only distinguish Chrome and Edge by UserAgent. But it is not a good idea at all.\n<br>I wish Microsoft can fix this issue.","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/133486530-wu-junhui","datetime":"2015-12-29","comments":[]}
