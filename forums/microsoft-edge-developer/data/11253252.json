I would just simply end the process in task manager and reopen explorer. However, this does not seem to work with Edge, once I end the process in task manager and start Edge again, it remembers the sites that I was on, and the popup continues! Please fix this by either prompt me the options if I want to restore the sites I was viewing or just open up my homepage or just default it to opening my homepage.","votes":"37","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/133727274-hao","datetime":"2015-12-29","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57616277-chris-love","datetime":"2017-01-13","body":"I would be interested in some examples of URLs that do this practice. I have found Edge tends to block those actions, but maybe I don't visit the right Internet neighborhoods."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/206721564-toan-nguyen","datetime":"2016-08-01","body":"I agreed with the above comment and I had the same issue. I hope Microsoft do something about this and have it fixed before the anniversary update. Once this is fixed and Edge support plug-ins, I'll give Edge another try!"}]}
