The -webkit-line-clamp- has severe limitations ( it's tricky to apply on a container with multiple children and different styles ) and performance impact ( directly correlated to the length of the textNodes thus you might need to trim them anyways to prevent janky scroll and reflows )."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/137798493-robert-colburn","datetime":"2016-01-25","body":"@David Storey,\n<br>I'm all for a better solution, and Presto's dated but elegant solution is fine as well. It would be great to see one of the browsers get behind an multi-line ellipses, and push a spec to the relevant committees. That said, let's try to avoid bike-shedding and get a solution out there. Currently, WebKit's undocumented solution is the only CSS solution out there, and it's in the wild and production-ready."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57613576-david-storey-msft","datetime":"2016-01-18","body":"Note that this is non-standard (there is no spec) and only works with the really old flex box syntax in WebKit/Blink, not the standard syntax.
