Think popup menus, delete or edit buttons, floating formatting toolbars, copy buttons, editing popups and so on. The list is endless. This is a good way to reduce visual clutter.\n<br>However, this is often done in an inaccessible way, just by using :hover, because making it accessible requires JS, since :focus does not apply to ancestors. However, 1 in 2 people writing HTML/CSS are not comfortable with JavaScript so keyboard accessibility (and usability, as many of us are keyboard users by choice) goes out of the window.\n<br>Selectors 4 fixes this by introducing :focus-within, which will work just like :hover in the sense that it will also apply to ancestors. This will make it trivial to make the UIs described above keyboard accessible.","votes":"2,245","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/71793849-lea-verou","datetime":"2016-02-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/926343760-heff","datetime":"2019-09-26","body":"This is working now from my testing. üëç"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/904357771-brian","datetime":"2019-06-05","body":"Why is this still missing?
