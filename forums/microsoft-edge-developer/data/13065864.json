Let web developer not be afraid to build up a browser extension. It’s because they can use the original web development skill to make one extension.\n<br>But in Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft does not provide the extension framework for web developer to build up a extension easily. So, I just create one to let web developer build an extension easily.\n<br>I wonder to know, why does Microsoft not just have this one to build IE Extension easily","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/153338712-bh-lin","datetime":"2016-03-21","comments":[]}
