We ship a product to customers, and would like to have support for new Edge features available at the same time as Edge updates roll out. Currently this means we would need to run our dev and QA environments on the Windows Insiders channel, which isn't really antiquate. It would also mean we aren't running the same version of Edge that our customers are. As a result features tend to lag several weeks or even months behind. This increases the risk of bugs, since we develop funcationality using \"feature detection.\" Any incompatibilities between implementations is known too late.","votes":"142","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/149107416-anonymous","datetime":"2016-04-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/848105299-bam","datetime":"2018-09-10","body":"Currently only stable version is available to download at <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/..\">https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/..</a>.
