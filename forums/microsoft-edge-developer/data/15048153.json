Even on 64-bit CPUs, you cannot run 64-bit VMs without hardware visualization support; this is still not common on laptops. Please reconsider the decision to lock out developers on year-old hardware from testing Edge, or compatibility of your new browser will suffer.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/184726914-anonymous","datetime":"2016-06-30","comments":[]}
