The F12 tools performance and its effect on the browser itself is terrible. The worst bits are that the browser crashes constantly (when testing a JS heavy app) and that the browser behaves differently when the F12 tools are enabled. I need to test my app with the F12 tools closed because opening it makes me chasing bugfoots around."}]}
