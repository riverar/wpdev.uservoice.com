Especially when we load resources from CDNs (like our own). In a mixed localhost / cdn Environment one will always see \"This Internet Explorer instance does not have privateNetworkClientServer capabilities\", which is a) misleading, since i'm using edge, not IE and is frustrating, since there is no internal Workaround. Fiddler allows me to remap mylocalhost to localhost, which solves the Problem, but I - as a developer - would like to just use it for development, as I do with all my other Browsers.","votes":"183","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/229633402-thomas-glatzer","datetime":"2016-08-29","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/857290702-thomas-glatzer","datetime":"2018-10-10","body":"This still applies for newer Edge versions, but the message got more confusing.\n<br>Now there's often no error-message but it just does not load."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/694430491","datetime":"2017-10-20","body":"+1."}]}
