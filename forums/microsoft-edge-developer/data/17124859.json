If I have dev tools open in the previous tab then start dev tools in the linked tab so I get the initialization. Starting the dev tools after the tab starts means the tools aren't running when that site loads. Add it as an option in the about:flags page.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/283251253-david-wolfe","datetime":"2016-11-15","comments":[]}
