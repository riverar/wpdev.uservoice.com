FF, Chrome and Safari all allow the databases to be many GBs depedning on available Hard Drive space. Our web application deals with a large amount of data and we use the database to pre-cache data for review later so that the review process is quick. We deal with massive amounts of data where each set of data to review is in the 100s of MB but can also easily exceed 1GB.
