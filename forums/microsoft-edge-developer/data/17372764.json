They should have the ability to highlight, create side notes, maybe have a little bit of cloud storage in it or an area where they can store resources and maybe contain downloadable references that aren't two pages long...and maybe ...for more advanced users...or maybe for everyone like receive some sort of points and have it rated on a real system where we can actually get free cool stuff like the prize system at chuck e cheese but for windows products ...and the opportunity to be in the running to create some cool code or game or software where users will be recognized for it by their internet peers and get a chance to have it marketed or whatever. Or at least given a free gift card to starbucks or walmart. ","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/294352222","datetime":"2016-12-08","comments":[]}
