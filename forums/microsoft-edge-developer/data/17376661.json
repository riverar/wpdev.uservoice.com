This is the #1 reason why I do not use Edge for developing and testing my app.  I don't always remember to hit F12 when testing and having all of my logs get lost because of this is a huge detractor.","votes":"28","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/294501133-kevin","datetime":"2016-12-08","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/294501670-todd","datetime":"2016-12-08","body":"This is the single biggest reason I don't test in Edge. Because if something goes wrong and I don't have the F12 tools open, I've already missed it. So much time saved by testing deving in Chrome where I can only open the F12 tools when I really need them and can rely on the relevant console messages always being there."}]}
