(the parent is overflow:auto or scroll) According to the w3c's specification, the scrollbars should disapear which just happens in chrome and firefox.\n<br>The specification is as follows:\n<br>For elements whose layout is governed by the CSS box model, the transform property does not affect the flow of the content surrounding the transformed element. However, the extent of the overflow area takes into account transformed elements. This behavior is similar to what happens when elements are offset via relative positioning. Therefore, if the value of the overflow property is scroll or auto, scrollbars will appear as needed to see content that is transformed outside the visible area.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/220447869-smalllong","datetime":"2017-01-22","comments":[]}
