Chrome, Firefox and now Edge - all seem to be using their own \"home grown\" version of a pdf viewer that is set as the default.  When people try to open a pdf that is xfa/xml based (not an Acroform, but one developed using Adobe's LiveCycle software) pdf, a new window comes up with an error message.  IE opens them in the browser just fine.  This seems a little odd to me as IE is also a Microsoft product - one browser works with xfa based pdf's and the other does not.  My suggestion is that you put out an update that sets Edge to use Adobe Reader as the default pdf viewer until such time as you can update your preferred pdf viewer to support xfa/xml based pdf's.  These types of pdf's are becoming more prevalent - even with government forms and documents - and have been around since pre-2006 so I'm not really seeing a reason they are not supported - particularly by a browser this new!","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/321139645-brian-falor","datetime":"2017-02-03","comments":[]}
