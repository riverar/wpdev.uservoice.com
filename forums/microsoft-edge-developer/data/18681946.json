The use of background colors can enhance layouts and make data more readable, such as on reports or calendars. This would still give the user the option to not allow background colors to print while giving the developer maximum flexibility.","votes":"197","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/346409533","datetime":"2017-03-21","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/892471570-j","datetime":"2019-04-04","body":"should match with other browsers!!!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/885449224-rr","datetime":"2019-02-22","body":"Edge is trash, enough to say."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/818089837","datetime":"2018-06-26","body":"It is the largest stupid thing in the world I have known that ms edge cannot print background color."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/681817321-matthew-beatty","datetime":"2017-10-10","body":"We have directed our current edge users to use Chrome to print, in an application where printing is a significant part of the job, because of this. We usually prefer to let users use whatever browser they choose as long as the browser still has support but with Edge lacking complete print support that is simply not an option for Edge."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/422477713-brad","datetime":"2017-07-25","body":"Yes, agree completely.
