Allowing extensions to override things like New Tab page would simultaneously address this concern and allow more Chrome extensions to be ported, making Edge a much nicer browser to use.","votes":"1,082","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/351342340-chris-h","datetime":"2017-04-03","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/920866867-ann-gercke","datetime":"2019-09-21","body":"PLEASE MAKE MOMENTUM AVAILABLE FOR EDGE PLEASE YOU DONT EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME EVERYONE GET PEOPLE TO COMMENT ON THIS FORUM.

Momentum is so much easier to use as a landing page. It says hello to me using my name, and hides the links that I don't want to see all day long. Edge's default page is blocky and doesn't really allow for good customization. For instance, I don't need, or want, news on my landing page. I don't want to look at blocky links every time I land, especially since they hide the one good feature: the pictures in the background."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/902428216","datetime":"2019-05-26","body":"This would be wonderful!\n"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/901164331-aryan","datetime":"2019-05-19","body":"+3 Momentum for Edge, I've been loving how smooth the scrolling is on Edge and how fluid the experience is with Windows Precision trackpad drivers.
