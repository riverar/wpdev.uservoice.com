This would be an incredible advancement to responsive web design since files are progressively encoded. That way, browsers could load only the first part of a FLIF file until it reaches the size that the browser needs. I truly can't wait for a main-stream browser to support FLIF and if edge were first to support it, that would be remarkable!"}]}
