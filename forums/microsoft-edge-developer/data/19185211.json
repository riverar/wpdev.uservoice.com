This feature will let users open all browser windows without any distracting animations or auto-playing video. Flash or html5 graphics will be frozen, displayed in black and white, non-animated.  No surprise sounds or video will be played out loud.  This will replace the need for ad block and pacify advertisers at the same time; because it does not completely block their messages. But it does restore some dignity to the browsing experience for whom would again like to use the internet for news gathering.
