The internet is a messy place. Using Edge without these, you get flooded with ads and can't actually see the content. Ads can contain phishing software and keystealers (BitDefender reports) and its not advisable to surf without these tools.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/382655740","datetime":"2017-05-24","comments":[]}
