Probably it returns an element's text as rendered using innerText. This is not in line with other webdrivers like Chrome, Safari and \"Microsoft\" IE webdriver.\n<br>Will be good if you can fix it to trim the extra whitespace characters by default. Will be very helpful, Thanks!","votes":"52","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/392831647-manish-singh","datetime":"2017-06-08","comments":[]}
