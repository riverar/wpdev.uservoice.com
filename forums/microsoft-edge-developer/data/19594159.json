Now you can still remove outline for :focus, but show outline for :focus-visible (keyboard focus)."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/744968473-melanie-richards-msft","datetime":"2018-02-28","body":"Updated the original title of this item (focus-ring) to :focus-visible, as the pseudo class has changed.
