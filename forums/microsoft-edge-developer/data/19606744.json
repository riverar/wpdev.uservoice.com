Chrome has a great feature in that if you do a \"Ctrl-F\" to search, and you start to type a term, Chrome will find instances of that search term in the text fields of a form.  Firefox does this as well.  Unfortunately, both IE &amp; Edge do not provide this feature.  IE/Edge will only search in the text that is on a page, not text that is in a value attribute of a text field.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/396305059-wally","datetime":"2017-06-15","comments":[]}
