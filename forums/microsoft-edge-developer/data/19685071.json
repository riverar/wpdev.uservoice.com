We have a script we run on the Windows 10 Stable VM to install some optional components and run functional tests using Edge, and it works great, but the preview VM can’t install things like .NET Framework 3.5 under Windows Features. I tried several tricks including playing with known group policy settings that affect this, but the VM doesn't seem to acknowledge any source as the correct version of media. Can you fix this so it behaves more like the stable VM?","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/398817517-jesse","datetime":"2017-06-21","comments":[]}
