It should be possible to persist the actual DOM state and all supporting JavaScript (even self-modified JavaScript) as it is and persist all of that in a giant static HTML file that is capable of being loaded standalone and off-line.  In other words ... no external references at all in the static html.  All images base64 encoded, etc.  See for instance the Jupyter Notebook's NBConvert tool which generates a single static HTML page for a Jupyter notebook.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/411771850-kevin-english","datetime":"2017-07-11","comments":[]}
