There should be an edit control that uses the Bing Maps APIs to map any address or valid location name to GPS coordinates that get used.  This way someone could enter an address such as \"One Microsoft Way, 98052\" and have this work.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/394097785-","datetime":"2017-09-13","comments":[]}
