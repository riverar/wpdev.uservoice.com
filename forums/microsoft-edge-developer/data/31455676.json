Chrome detects automatically, that these characters need RTL-direction and shows them accordingly in RTL directly.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/670765552-heiko","datetime":"2017-09-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/762911356","datetime":"2018-03-04","body":"Did you set &lt;html dir=\"rtl\"&gt;?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/670765552-heiko","datetime":"2017-09-18","body":"The sample above uses hebrew characters, for which the issue occurs as well, due to its RTL-direction."}]}
