I almost was going to stay with Edge, but didn't find that important extension that I need. Also, the option to disable Edge would be good in case I want to enable it in the future. Right now, I hate the process that I need to go thru to disable it. Way better if I could disable it as with Windows 7 had with IE.

I am not Edge developer but simply browser user.  Thanks for receiving my feedback and I am hoping success for Edge because I kind of like it, just the lack of extension is right now that is breaking the deal. "}]}
