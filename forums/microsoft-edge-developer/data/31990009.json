Most antivirus programs and download managers make use of this capability.","votes":"80","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/699047638-robert-saeger","datetime":"2017-10-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/824977666-beau","datetime":"2018-07-18","body":"100% agree. There are legitimate business reasons to allow programatically installed/enforced extensions. IE has it, Chrome has it. Firefox doesn't let you enforce, but at least you can install. Edge seems like a half-baked toy because of this limitation. Browsers that do not have this capability are not options for businesses that need it."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/785507725-ofek-shilon","datetime":"2018-05-09","body":"Yesyesyesyes"}]}
