Looking at Task Manager, the Edge process is not using the NVidia discrete GPU *at all*. WebVR on the Surface Book 2 was similarly poor in performance. Please use the dGPU when WebGL or WebVR are in-use on a tab. If that means the tab has to be suspended or reloaded when detaching, that's fine by me.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/751575910-matt-hargett","datetime":"2018-02-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/768017329-saverio","datetime":"2018-03-18","body":"I'm a Surface Book 2 user and I'm experiencing the same issue.
