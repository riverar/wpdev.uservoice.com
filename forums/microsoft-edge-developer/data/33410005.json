ITP is a sensible compromise between no privacy and ad-blocking since it enables advertising without abandoning data protection. Since there is no existing standard, Edge could experiment with an approach different from ITP, but it's a good starting point (and does not break the Web).","votes":"109","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/758986462-robin-berjon","datetime":"2018-02-21","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57635298-%C5%A1ime-vidas","datetime":"2018-02-22","body":"Safari has ITP, Firefox has Tracking Protection, some other browsers including Opera, Brave, and UC have built-in ad blockers that also serve as tracking protection.
