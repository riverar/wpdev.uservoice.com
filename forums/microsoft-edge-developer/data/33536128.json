Edge also can do this now with PDFs.   The next logical step, from my point of view as a developer, is to let webpage javascript get information from these highlights.   For instance, lets suppose I use html 'frames tag' to host one webpage in another.   My user highlights the page (or HTML) in that frame, and an event fires letting me capture the text that he highlighted.   Conversely, if my code wants to highlight something for the user, it should be able to do that.   There would be an advantage would be for PDFs, since I myself have coded (though not perfectly) highlighting for regular web content, and so has a company called 'genius.com'.  PDFs often have math formulas or special formatting that cannot be shown properly in HTML.\n<br> \n<br>Thanks.
