When NCrunch kicks off tests impacted by changes I have made, by Edge browsers shut down, with all the tabs and windows lost forever.\n<br>The IE Web Driver didn't have this issue and while I know that the browsers are not the same, the expectation is that they would behave similarly.\n<br>Allowing the Edge Web Driver to trigger and manage its own windows, separate from any that the user has opened and is currently using, would be a welcomed addition to the project.\n","votes":"18","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/767106967-shafiq","datetime":"2018-03-15","comments":[]}
