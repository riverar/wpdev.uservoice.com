(Even with a progressive enhancement mindset, there are times when the IE experience has to be pretty close to the experience in other browsers. In those cases, using the new features often doesn't make sense â€”&nbsp;it would just mean implementing the same functionality two different ways.)","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/795055162","datetime":"2018-06-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/795055162","datetime":"2018-06-02","body":"Another way to get at the same goal might be for Microsoft to make (and automatically install something like Chrome Frame (\"Edge Frame\") into IE, so that those who are using IE see some websites rendered with the Edge engine if those sites opt in."}]}
