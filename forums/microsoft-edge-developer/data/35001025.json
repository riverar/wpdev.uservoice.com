Big apps. Very good performance, stable, simple. Lots of custom Dlls as you say, mostly base VBScript, with some JavaScript mixing when we need to perform on the fly interpretation (evals !) or date manipulations... \n<br>+1 for classic ASP to be brought back. But it has to be kept VERY simple, as it is now !\n<br>:-)"}]}
