To do it now, you have to detach this tab, and on new window press \"set these tabs aside\" button. It would be great to have \"Set aside\" button in context menu of an individual tab.","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/276348028-merdan-gochmuradov","datetime":"2018-09-09","comments":[]}
