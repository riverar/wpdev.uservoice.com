One of the key reasons for this is that many web apps/portals used by staff require permissions from the Trusted Sites zone which Edge does not support. As a result, these apps do not work correctly and the userbase is abandoning Edge in droves in preference of Chrome as the preferred browser.  Microsoft needs to introduce support of the Trusted Sites zone into Edge.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/848339968-w-deguara","datetime":"2018-09-10","comments":[]}
