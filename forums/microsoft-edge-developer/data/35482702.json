Terrible. Adobe reader is great and Edge is very weak. please please stop it. it is the biggest flaw with Windows 10 (even worse than the games and bloatware)\n","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/851899117-me","datetime":"2018-09-21","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/874315360-john","datetime":"2018-12-05","body":"This is part of the reason I do not think I will ever use Edge as my primary browser.
