Anytime when I sign in with Microsoft account and try to sing up for developer's account, the account type is already selected and I can't change it. So I stopped there, I didn't create the account. How can I change that to an individual? ","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/852863518-samson","datetime":"2018-09-25","comments":[]}
