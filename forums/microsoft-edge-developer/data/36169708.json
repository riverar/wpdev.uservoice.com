At work we have the option of using old Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. because one of our software","body":"Recently at work we upgraded to Windows 10. We still have the option of using Windows 8.1. Reason being our Software System that is pertinent to our business only works well with 8.1. There is another issue that I have found with Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 when using simultaneously. In Windows 8.1 when you click on a link to a webinar, a video, or fill out a form or application where you have to hit a submit button to send. There are many applications that will not work by clicking on the link you have to open Microsoft Edge and copy and paste the link and Edge in order for it to submit a form or open a link to another source. This is a work around that we have been using for a long time but it is very frustrating. Is this something that was just locked out of 8.1 or is it because the other end is using 10 and it's not compatible if I'm using 8.1? My email address no longer works but I'm going to go ahead and enter it in the Box down below anyway","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/873835516-jenn","datetime":"2018-12-02","comments":[]}
