It is unclear why I don't get permission and I didn't receive any response on my questions for about three weeks now. My customers are waiting however and I did pay Microsoft so I do expect support to get the extension published.\n<br>My extensions store ID is 9P16GP71KWZT.\n<br>The chrome version of the extension is available in the chrome store.\n","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/875734306-merijn-de-jonge","datetime":"2018-12-15","comments":[]}
