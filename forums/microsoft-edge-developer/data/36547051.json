You've really buggered up your own product here.  What idiot approved development of a product that doesn't have at least the same functionality as the one it replaced?  Edge may run faster, but your users have to waste their own time doing simple **** like printing, which is now no longer a simple click on a single button.  Edge doesn't even preselect the buttons it does have.  MS, stop screwing your user base and forcing us into other user friendlier apps.
