The current location of Edge favourites' links is utterly ridiculous - the pathway is about a page long, and clearly intended to prevent users from directly managing their bookmark links the same way we could with IE.  This is ****, and if MS had any sort of interest in their clients and user base, they wouldn't make such stupid, alienating, non-consultative decisions.\n<br>Fix this now, before we all choose Firefox instead !!!!!!","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880273366-robert","datetime":"2019-01-17","comments":[]}
