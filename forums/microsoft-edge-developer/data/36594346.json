It takes me quite a while to find it. It seems the logic is each tab has a parent and new tabs are added at the end of all children from the parent tab. Where other browsers add the new tab at the beginning, meaning you know where it's going to be.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880980370-wouter-vos","datetime":"2019-01-22","comments":[]}
