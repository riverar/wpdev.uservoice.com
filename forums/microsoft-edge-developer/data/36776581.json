I am passionate about continuous improvement and feel that I could be of great use to the MS team. While I don't have formal training in UX, it appears that hasn't been a requirement thus far. I believe in MS and it's potential in creating a robust browser and sure if applications that will rival Google; I'm just not sure what's taking so long. I have uninstalled or disabled all Google products from my laptop and mobile phone but only made it 2 days. Edge freezes, maps aren't integrated, and apps are sihloed to the extent that interpretability is painful. Google is an evil empire that must be stopped. At this rate, I believe even money says an upstart avoiding destruction/consumption by Google is just as likely as MS creating an effective suite of mobility apps.
