Those who sport tablets have iPads and occasionally Android tablets.  When developing for this device environment we have to consider emulation and only use real devices when testing.  We are trying hard to adopt Edge as a development browser but with the current developer tools emulation only having Windows Phone devices out of the box our guys have to resort to custom configurations.  Considering the market share of Windows Phone devices versus the market share of Android and iOS devices it doesn't make sense for us to use Edge on our dev boxes and as such we default to Chrome.  The result is that our user experience is very refined for Chrome on Windows, quite good for iOS devices and rather choppy for Edge on Windows.  I believe that if we managed to default to Edge as a dev browser we could improve that experience but it won't happen as long as device emulation is so limited out of the box.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/884439484-rmx","datetime":"2019-02-15","comments":[]}
