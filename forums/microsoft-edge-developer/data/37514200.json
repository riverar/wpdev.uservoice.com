The reason is that most of the readers are NOT private but cloud services.  As Edge tries to differentiate itself from Chrome (but use the chromium engine), but that feature back into Edge and let me securely (me and only me), know what I am subscribed to and my reading habits.  Most require logons.  That should not be needed.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/897930364-wsmith","datetime":"2019-04-30","comments":[]}
