Chrome and beta Chromium Edge does not allow this, although Firefox does. I develop an interactive electronic technical manual (IETM) for the DOD that needs a cookie set to \"remember' the configuration of the IETM set through a Form selection passed through the URL to enter the main page. It does not work in this beta Chromium Edge. It has always worked in IE back to Quirks and through IE11 and current EDGE with Win10. please restore this functionality.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/917089513-rk","datetime":"2019-09-03","comments":[]}
