When carrying out a find across files operation in the debugger (by pressing enter) the results will be shown in a pane that lists out all the matches along with a preview. The list of results can be used to navigate the editor to the results.\n<br> \n<br>Proposed Design\n<br>- A light dismiss pane that will replace the console window when displayed\n<br>- Navigating the results pane (mouse or keyboard) will change the editor view but will not set focus in the editor \n<br>- Activating a match will change the editor focus and dismiss the find results pane\n<br> \n","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53924273-andy-sterland","datetime":"2014-07-28","comments":[]}
