This would eliminate 99% of the need for fiddler. So many times we need to redirect just one or two urls of a production site to an updated js/css file to diagnose an issue or prototype a quick fix/change. Fiddler is such overkill and such a pain to use and very often not available on the machine we have to work from. Looking at the popularity of fiddler and what a huge percentage of its use is for this simple redirect scenario this seems like a pretty easy no brainer that would benefit so many developers."}]}
