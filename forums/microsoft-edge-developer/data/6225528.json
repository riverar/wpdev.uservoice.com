While moving the mouse cursor, a label should be drawn next to the cursor that indicates the x, y and angle (0' is vertically up) distance in pixels from the origin\n<br>- The ruler and text need a contrasting background","votes":"33","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53924273-andy-sterland","datetime":"2014-07-28","comments":[]}
