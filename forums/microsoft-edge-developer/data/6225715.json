This is sorely lacking in Edge and very disappointing.  It makes me prefer not to debug in Edge."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57616277-chris-love","datetime":"2016-11-26","body":"These are great suggestions. Maybe enable some sort of faceted filtering panel or shelf that could be displayed on demand with these options. For example the status would have some common status codes, but also need the ability to manually enter a code number. As I write this I am also thinking you might want some sort of range for those as well. Other fields would warrant different value types. Maybe a regex filter, etc would be a good option."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/63405168-david-gardiner","datetime":"2015-01-14","body":"I'd specifically like to be able to filter out (exclude) messages related to Browser Link"}]}
