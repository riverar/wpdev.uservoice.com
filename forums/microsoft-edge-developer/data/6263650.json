There is a usage pattern for additive, where many concurrent animations on the same property run relative to the underlying value. This is a superior technique for simple transitions, in particular when interrupting or reversing. Formerly, one would simply replace an animation with a new one than continued where the previous left off. But if all animations have a destination value of zero, it permits seamless blending and gives beautiful curves, without mutating, all built from more primitive methods."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60606971-kertis","datetime":"2014-12-30","body":"this is a must-have feature,a dream come true for all JavaScript developers .
