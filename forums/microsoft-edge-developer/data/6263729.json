There are so many examples where input[type=number] is really not applicable but you do want a numeric keyboard."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/65928106-scunliffe","datetime":"2015-09-05","body":"This is helpful for other reasons too. Currently type=\"number\" is great and shows the correct keyboard on mobile devices.  However any attempt to set a partial value, or use any of the selection properties/methods fails.  Having the inputmode attribute available would mean we can choose the best input device keyboard but not suffer the side-effects of setting the field as number."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/71238088-daniel-aleksandersen","datetime":"2015-05-05","body":"This is actually a really useful feature as input[type=number] has serious localization and usability issues."}]}
