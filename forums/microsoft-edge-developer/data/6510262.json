Since it is based on the hierachical DNSSEC system, it doesn't have the flaw of having numerous (and sometimes a bit untrustworthy) certificate authorities all able to issue certificates for any domain.  By making CAs unnecessay for domain-only certificates, it would shift their market to providing more reliable validation of additional information, such as who is the owner of the domain.","votes":"36","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57626597-lionel-fourquaux","datetime":"2014-10-01","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/290011478-alice-wonder","datetime":"2016-12-01","body":"Please PLEASE support DANE.
