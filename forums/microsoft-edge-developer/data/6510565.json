Backwards compatibility with non-standard implementations of web technology encourages the continued use of code that generally breaks web compatibility by developers, causes code bloat in the browser, and makes compatibility testing more complicated for web developers. Time and effort would be much better directed at actually implementing web standards (HTML5, CSS3, ES6)."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57616277-chris-love","datetime":"2015-05-11","body":"IE 11 includes Enterprise Mode, which provides the solution you are looking for.
