Often, when using a high number of tabs (common in development), IE will overload the available graphics memory (never RAM), and elements will start disappearing from web pages or failing to load altogether.","votes":"257","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57646165-david","datetime":"2014-10-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59431035-serg","datetime":"2015-01-23","body":"Right now opening 10+ tabs kills a machine with 6-8GB of RAM. Not only IE kills CPU while displaying 10+ text mostly pages it also constantly doing disk IO. It doesn't seem right since other resource-intensive applications can work quite OK without saturating all resources.
