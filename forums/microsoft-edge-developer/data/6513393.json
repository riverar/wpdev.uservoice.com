It is intended to be a replacement for simple animated images that have traditionally used the GIF format, while adding support for 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency. APNG is backwards-compatible with PNG; any PNG decoder should be able to ignore the APNG-specific chunks and display a single image.","votes":"11,425","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57662523-evgeny-vrublevsky-veg","datetime":"2014-10-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/920517592-lulu-gva","datetime":"2019-09-18","body":"+"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/916998775-%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B9","datetime":"2019-09-03","body":"+"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/916886704-irakli","datetime":"2019-09-02","body":"+ all "},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/911735863-andy","datetime":"2019-07-22","body":"+3"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/903972781-jeff","datetime":"2019-06-02","body":"+"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/903093865-dsadfsaf","datetime":"2019-05-29","body":"+111"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/899131789-d-p","datetime":"2019-05-07","body":"+999999999999"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/892679653","datetime":"2019-04-05","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/890871535-%E7%8E%8B%E6%98%93","datetime":"2019-03-27","body":"+1 Just do it!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/888824638-popjosef","datetime":"2019-03-15","body":"+1 Just do it!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/888469612-post-micro","datetime":"2019-03-13","body":"+1001"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/887029624","datetime":"2019-03-05","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/886351687-jorz","datetime":"2019-02-28","body":"Bring it!\n<br>+1000"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/885075985-richard-schwarz","datetime":"2019-02-19","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/884785651-karthik-a-r","datetime":"2019-02-18","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/884495977-miek-thompson","datetime":"2019-02-15","body":"+9001"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/883936591","datetime":"2019-02-11","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/882926443","datetime":"2019-02-04","body":"APNG"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/878166997","datetime":"2019-01-03","body":"+1"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/852822559-%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D1%88%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2","datetime":"2018-12-09","body":"Microsoft Edge: Making the web better through more open source collaboration"}]}
