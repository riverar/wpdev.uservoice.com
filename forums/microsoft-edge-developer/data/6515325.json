If I do ajax-request from one domain to another that request send without cookies information at all. It's like sandboxing, even if I write correct P3P-header. \n<br>Now I use workaround, like <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain\">https://github.com/jpillora/xdomain</a> but i need to include it in ie-only way. I want more simple and clean solution. Other browser-engines (webkit, firefox, presto) allow me to send and receive cross-domain cookies","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57685481-alex-troll","datetime":"2014-10-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60095355","datetime":"2014-11-17","body":"+"}]}
