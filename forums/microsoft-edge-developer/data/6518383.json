But the myriad of compromised machines due to old IE versions running on them hurts the internet as a whole - including your customers on newer Windows versions. It may be impossible to run the latest IE with all bells and whistles on an old OS, but maybe one just with a core feature set (and the security patches) would help patching the leaks until those systems get replaced.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57722988-carlos-duarte-do-nascimento","datetime":"2014-10-03","comments":[]}
