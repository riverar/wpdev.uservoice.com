Running automated tests on IE often fails because the browser either fails to start up or shut down properly. With a headless browser multiple browser instances can be run in parallel without taking up screen space.","votes":"1,800","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58054964-marius-gundersen","datetime":"2014-10-10","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/907027690-jonathan-dodd","datetime":"2019-06-13","body":"Seeming that Azure DevOps supports automated UI testing using Selenium and that this is a request since 2014, surely some response from Microsoft is overdue?!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/900785929-izzyonstage","datetime":"2019-05-16","body":"Typical MS Wandos...\n<br>Make the browser core to the OS and still refuse to give even the most basic of developer requirements an ear.\n<br>90% of dev today is web based.\n<br>Why is MS intent on refusing the dev community from testing with the native browser????????"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/881376718-gary-jackson","datetime":"2019-01-24","body":"Please keep in mind that I use Microsoft tools daily and am a fan of most their applications and IDEs.   To the point:\n<br>Microsoft itself, stated in court when accused of monopolizing the Web Browser market with IE bundled in the OS that browsers were the future of Operating Systems and without coupling the browser with the OS they could lose future market share.   I think that Microsoft could take back a large part of its lost market share by making their browser run headless and fixing the xPath issues, along with a few other items I am sure that they are aware of.   The fact that it is bundled with the OS alone should make it more popular as its accessibility could be a major factor, if it simply kept up with its competition."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/872764633-morten-bjoernsvik","datetime":"2018-11-26","body":"I'm really surprised headless is still not supported for Edge. To run scheduled automatic tests on a CI system, jenkins, teamcity, travis etc. where you do not have a graphic console. Headless is needed. Both Firefox and Chrome have had it for years. Result we test on FF and Chrome and not Edge. Result People using Edge feels Edge being immature and switch to Chrome instead.
