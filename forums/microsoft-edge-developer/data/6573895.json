I always need to google-hacks or I had to write additional code. Only once in my life IE works better than other browsers (IE10 and minor CSS issue works as expected in IE). Trusted engines should be easy to switch for any user. Allowing to use other engines under IE will solve a lot of coding just for IE only. Like <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5608\">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-5608</a> special patch for one IE version. When new IE version was released patch was not needed however I need to add new script-code and rewrite functions.
