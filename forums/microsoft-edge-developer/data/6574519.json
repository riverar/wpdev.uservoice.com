More specifically, I do it mostly with two YouTube videos where I copy title, description, keywords and even a message for subscribers (and GPS location). In some cases, it's because the content for both movies is similar enough, to use as a template, and in some because I have two movies for virtually the same thing (short and real-time).","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58412368-sr%C4%91an-cani%C4%87","datetime":"2014-10-17","comments":[]}
