You have general cookies, pop-ups, images, etc settings. But you can also right-click any webpage and customize settings for it alone. For some web sites, I don't want any pop-up, even those that happen when I click on something (or especially those). In some pages I may not want any images or any images above certain resolution, as they are simply ads. And in some web sites, I don't want any flash content as I know it is only used for ads (like in forums, where you don't have any useful content in flash.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58412368-sr%C4%91an-cani%C4%87","datetime":"2014-10-17","comments":[]}
