They work perfectly when uploaded to a server, but for some reason locally IE doesn't see my css @import rules, or doesn't register certain scripts for inexplicable reasons, or various other issues like that. Websites should render locally exactly as they do server side wherever possible. Obviously I don't expect things like PHP code to work, but anything that can work, should.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57824217-jacob","datetime":"2014-11-19","comments":[]}
