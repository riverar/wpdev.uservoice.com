It would be nice if the zoom and orientation properties were supported, too (in addition to the rest of the spec), so that we'd get a real replacement for the non-standard viewport &lt;meta&gt; tag.","votes":"39","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57654986-mnsth","datetime":"2014-11-27","comments":[]}
