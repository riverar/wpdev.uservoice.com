IE could offer a similar functionality to say \"this certificate is for these URLs\", that is a list of URLs to be maintained per certificate. Or map URL patterns to certificates based on their attributes, e.g. Issuer or FriendlyName. The IE then automatically selects the right certificate and the user is freed from the decision, which certificate to choose, especially if he has more than one from the same Root CA. The certificate selection dialog is then only needed if the same URL is configured for more than one certificate or no URLs were configured.
