While other browsers consider '1ch' equal to the overall width of the character, including its side-bearings, IE seems to take into account only the width of the painted area, without side-bearings. This makes IE's implementation almost useless in practical tasks like <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://lea.verou.me/2012/02/simpler-css-typing-animation-with-the-ch-unit/\">http://lea.verou.me/2012/02/simpler-css-typing-animation-with-the-ch-unit/</a>. Can the implementation of this unit be changed for the parity with other browsers, so we could use it interoperably?","votes":"36","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59929543","datetime":"2014-12-22","comments":[]}
