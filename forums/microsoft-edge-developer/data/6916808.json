It's a super simple tool for defining and saving HTTP requests for playback. While that's nice in itself, what about taking things much further by allowing developers to create 'macros' or custom scripts to run in IE dev tools to help automate things like test cases, bug reproduction steps or more esoteric things like scripts to collect diagnostic information from (nontechnical) clients.\n<br>It would be nice to have a super-simple way to create scripts to automate tasks *specific* to developer scenarios. (Without the overhead of custom browser extensions and such.)\n<br>Going further (and I realize this is much easier to type than to implement), having the ability for technical and non-technical people alike to 'record' these macros to share and attach to open bugs and such.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/62708064-%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%8F-%D0%B8","datetime":"2015-01-03","comments":[]}
