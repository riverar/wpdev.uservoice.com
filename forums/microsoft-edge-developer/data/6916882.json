I find this to be particularly true among clients using ultra books and tablets with less than 1080 vertical pixels.  I realize the F12 tools already dock/undock, minimize and are themselves resizable but that only goes so far on such small screens.  (Note: I’m referring specifically to cases where issues are not reproducible on development machines and thus the emulation options, as great as they are, wouldn’t help here.)","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/62708064-%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F%D1%8F-%D0%B8","datetime":"2015-01-03","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/64776251-felix-becker","datetime":"2015-08-02","body":"I would suggest when horizontally docked, when clicking a button with an array-down it rolls down to only the title bar on the buttom of the browser. clicking that same button with array-up brings it back up.
