Implementing it in IE/Spartan would mean that assistive tech implementers would have an interoperable accessibility API in all major windows browsers, and could therefore focus their limited resources on supporting it rather than having to implement UI automation just for Microsoft browsers. It would also lead to less buggy implementations of accessibility APIs in browsers. A win for users and implementers.","votes":"185","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/63824980-steve-faulkner","datetime":"2015-01-22","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/94799553","datetime":"2015-08-13","body":"Goodness, yes, please.
