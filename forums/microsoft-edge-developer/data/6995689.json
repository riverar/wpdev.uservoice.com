This is ok. But if you have to renew a certificate (because of expiration policy) and install the new one (having the old and the new installed at the same time and certificate store) it will not show as available to authenticate with. I guess there is some grouping happening and taking the first certificate or something similar.\n<br>The expected behavior is to show the newly installed certificate even if the old is still installed.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/63830297-daniel-tsviatkov","datetime":"2015-01-22","comments":[]}
