I have been debugging some jQuery code that intercepts form submit to make three nested async calls to a crypto library.  Each completion handler sets a hidden field and invokes the next crypto op.  The last invokes the form submit.  It was driving me batsh!t that none of my console.log messages were showing up.  Took me a while to realize that the form submit caused navigation which by default clears the console.  I was surprised to find that the default value for \"clear on navigate\" is enabled with no obvious way to make the default be disabled.  Thanks."}]}
