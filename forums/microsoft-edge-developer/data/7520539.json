Fine. But every time a video doesn't work or a plugin is needed the desktop version is opened. Then you have to manually click the keyboard icon to input anything. Did you even test this \"experience\" before shipping windows 8? Needless to say it works in Chrome.\n<br>Try filling a form with the desktop version on a touch device. Then repeat for a week and tell me this isn't needed. I'll go as far as to call it a bug.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/71039635","datetime":"2015-04-10","comments":[]}
