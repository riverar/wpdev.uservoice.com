(The system could specify in CSS the same shape, like a circle, for every image. But not if the image shape is different each time.)\n<br>Like this:\n<br>&lt;img src=\"foo.jpg\" style=\"shape-outside: url(foo.jpg); /&gt;\n<br>This is much harder for authors to implement, given the reality of constrains of most systems.
