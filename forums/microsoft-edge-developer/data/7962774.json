Firefox has DirectWrite parameters in about:config and it's complex but can be simplified by installing anti-aliasing tuner extension. IE has terrible font rendering. IE9 font rendering can be tweaked by installing AATIE plugin but AATIE plugin won't work in IE10 and IE11. We Hope IE/Edge will have built-in DirectWrite Anti-Aliasing Tuner to give us the choice of tweaking DirectWrite font rendering in a very simple manner. It should include the ability to use Outline (Unhinted Grayscale) rendering and different font rendering between font sizes.","votes":"56","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/76507437-theody","datetime":"2015-05-15","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/91134310-brian-chavez","datetime":"2015-07-29","body":"I'd second this, in addition to having the ability to DISABLE font-smoothing/ClearType/anti-aliased text. As someone with myopic vision, I don't need my computer helping me blur text when my myopia does it for me."}]}
