I prefer to keep developer tools docked when I'm working, but with IE the height of the dev tools window is limited, which forces me to either work in a cramped area or undock the tools.  Chrome and firefox both allow you to increase the size of the devtools to as tall as you'd like, which makes them much more usable with portrait screens.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/79756764-steven-johnson","datetime":"2015-06-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/79756764-steven-johnson","datetime":"2015-06-05","body":"Also, this may have been fixed already in Edge.
