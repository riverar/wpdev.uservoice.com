I've noticed that the reading wiev of Edge does not by default support rendering pictures and SVG content. Can you consider adding optional HTML attribute for when we WANT the content to be accessible when the user opts to view our page in Reading mode? It would be most helpful for instructions, HowTo's and other content where images are a must.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/86549470-illsteward","datetime":"2015-07-10","comments":[]}
