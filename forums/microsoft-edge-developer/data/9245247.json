The closest I've been able to come to the edge ctrl+shift+p new all InPrivate mode instance of edge experience from a command line is using \"start shell:AppsFolder\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge &amp; sleep 1 &amp; start shell:AppsFolder\\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge about:InPrivate\".
