When I am looking at the Network tab, I can see a list of elements.  I can select an element by tapping on it.  However, I am unable to access the properties menu (tap and press).  Instead, I have to use a mouse to right-click on the element to see the properties menu.  Can you add the touch screen (tap and press) gesture for accessing the properties of items shown on the Network tab?  Thanks.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/95024856-jk","datetime":"2015-08-14","comments":[]}
