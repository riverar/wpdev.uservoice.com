It tries its best to pass along Source Maps and Chrome today works alright with SystemJS, but today IE/Edge doesn't seem able to work with these source files. Some of this might be assuaged as IE/Edge implements the ES6/ES2015 Module Loader, but until such time, it would be great if the Dev Tools supported Source Maps in the way that SystemJS is outputting them in a stronger fashion.","votes":"109","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/105954267","datetime":"2015-09-25","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/106431990-anonymous","datetime":"2015-10-05","body":"Basically SystemJS loads/executes modules with xhr and eval, IE/Edge does not seem to be able to debug sources loaded this way at all, it does not matter if there are source maps involved or not, so the issue is the same for pure javascript loaded/executed with xhr/eval"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/106801137-greg-gum","datetime":"2015-09-29","body":"Yes, debugging in Visual Studio instead of Chrome would be a vast improvement."}]}
