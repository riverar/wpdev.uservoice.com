Because enabling Cortana requires us to login using MS account. And since you cannot login to MS account in Windows Mobile 10 emulator due to permission/trusted device issue it is impossible to enable and test/develop an application that uses Cortana.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/71584908","datetime":"2015-10-03","comments":[]}
