It's not fair to the developer that ads can sometimes start days or weeks after the app is published.  Many apps have cloud services behind them that cost money and no revenue is generated for up to two weeks in some situations.  How would Microsoft like it if devs were paid two weeks before their app went on the store?","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60342789","datetime":"2015-10-09","comments":[]}
