Currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps, easily know the revenue earned. More I earn, more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps. Please take a note of this. Both Apple and Google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role, who has no access to sales/revenue reports.
