The current WebAPIs are too limited for developers to create a new browser. You should give people more freedom and more APIs to create new browsers. And please don't always use security risk as excuse for not allowing people to create more creative apps than Edge. \n<br> \n<br>I'd like to suggest that creating APIs for:\n<br>1, Allowing specify proxies in third-party apps.\n<br>2, More events support for WebView: for example, gesture support\n<br>3, Allowing third-party Apps to processing the network input/output, like handling CSS/Javascript files/image files/stream files.\n<br>4, Allowing third-party Apps to manipulate DOM elements.\n","votes":"15","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/124745004-jie-liu","datetime":"2015-11-22","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/94089363-syn-mcj","datetime":"2016-04-21","body":"Would be also great to be able to allow window.external.notify for any website, not only those which specified in the manifest."}]}
