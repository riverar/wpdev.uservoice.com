Unfortunately, neither the SmartCard class nor the SmartCardProvisioning class (nor any other related class) provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later. A getter for this value should be added.","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/124784433-carl-wallace","datetime":"2015-11-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880266946","datetime":"2019-01-17","body":"I like this!"}]}
