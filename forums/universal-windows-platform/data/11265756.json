Using EF6/7 will only provide direct access to SqlLite and not regular DBs. \n<br>MS shall change EF7 to allow DB connectivity via batch data return like 50/100 return records at a time instead of \"SELECT *\" returning entire DB-Table data in one shot.  Without this feature definitely not all windows apps will be ported to UWP for the simple reason - \"We don't want to write another AZURE service to handle DB activity\".","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/133987824-raja-venkatesh","datetime":"2015-12-30","comments":[]}
