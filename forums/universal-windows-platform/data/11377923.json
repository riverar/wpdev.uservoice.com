I have about 40 apps and around 8 are visible. Even if I click on the developer name it still does not show all my apps. If i do a deep link then yes it find the apps and you can download them but it wont find them with keywords or App Name. This is the same issue for all Windows Stores. Phone 8.1, Phone 10, Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10. Every version of Windows does not show my apps. I actually had one of my apps appear and then disappear a day later. This is unacceptable and is a strong deterrent to creating apps for Windows.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53919079","datetime":"2016-01-11","comments":[]}
