I've been trying to compile some stuff and the compiler is necessarily creating processes with enormous arguments. Everything would be fine, but MAXPATH is too short to let it succeed! This is the only reason I've got to switch to linux, as I'm not in a position to change MAXPATH or rewrite the way the compiler calls processes.
