Also the WebView allows scripts from any source to load even though the page is loaded via HTTPS.\n<br>These are business critical security features that the WebView must support at least via opt-in or specific manifest settings. Note both these features work in Edge, so I guess it's just a matter of making it available in WebView.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/32411334-martin-suchan","datetime":"2016-01-18","comments":[]}
