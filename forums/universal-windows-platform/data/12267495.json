I've got several complaints now from angry users which accidently bought the misleading PRO app instead of my IAP or confused users who bought my IAP and wonder why they can not download the PRO app. This could easily be fixed by Microsoft, by at least giving the developer a chance to claim these suffixes from misleading apps. And in my case the misleading app does not offer a trial so the user has no chance of knowing until he bought the app)."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/148239672-mbrdev","datetime":"2016-02-27","body":"This would definitely be a huge help to stop a lot of copy cat apps stealing users."}]}
