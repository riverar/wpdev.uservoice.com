And if devs respond to that reviews, it will also be deleted. This is ridiculous behavior for both users and devs. If MS will disable rates/reviews sent from Win10 IP, disallow users to rate/review.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/29948871-shingo","datetime":"2016-02-23","comments":[]}
