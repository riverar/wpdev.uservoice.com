(Previous version of dev center was able to set by local currency. This is degraded.)\n<br>USD is not familiar for us. (We use different local currency basically.)\n<br>There is no conversion list between USD and local currency.\n<br>Microsoft sometimes changes conversion rate due to foreign exchange conversion rate. Because of this, it is hard to find expected price by our local currency. At least please provide app price conversion list between USD and local currency.\n<br>For example, 0.99 USD - 100 JPY","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/148974018-n-s","datetime":"2016-03-01","comments":[]}
