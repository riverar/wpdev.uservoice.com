Too bad you don't see them so for now. You can choose to remain on Win32 apps and Win7, the rest of the world will move on and we'll see you down the line in 15yrs when malware own your base like we have now for WannaCry. This is technology, if doesn't move-on, it will die. Period. Go ask IBM. You should not be afraid of the future."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/375071695-mcakins","datetime":"2017-05-14","body":"I don't know if you guys have noticed, but Notification Bar is taking over the function of System Tray gradually. This is evolutionary and possibly the future for Microsoft. You can have Active state now in there to show status and activate your app. I don't have official confirmation from MS on this just a tech-trend I'm seeing. I think MS should come out and confirm that Sys-tray is being deprecated so Devs know what to expect."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/183220545-rafael-rivera","datetime":"2017-05-14","body":"This is a blocker for my EAP Desktop Bridge app looking to fully migrate to UWP."}]}
