There are a few techniques you can use to reduce the payload size, which might help depending on your type of content. For image-heavy tiles, you can use the baseUri attribute on &lt;visual&gt; or &lt;binding&gt; to set a base path for any images. Another technique is to remove all whitespace before creating the tile notification, which can save a fair amount of space as well. In the future do we hope to increase the 5kb notification limit, but for now, hopefully those workarounds will help!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/154469313-pekspro","datetime":"2016-04-22","body":"Sorry for my late response, it’s been a very busy week for me :-(."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/40760483-matt-hidinger","datetime":"2016-04-15","body":"Hopefully you shouldn't need to query for a template. The general idea is that you can send a single payload with all bindings your app supports, regardless of whether a particular binding is supported on the OS. For example, you can add a TileLarge binding to all tile notifications that you send, including to Mobile and PC. If the binding isn't supported it will simply find the next one that is."}]}
