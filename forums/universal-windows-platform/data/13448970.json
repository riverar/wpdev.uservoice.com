But then i found out that when trying to recognize what I wrote, on PC it finds the necessary handwriting packages, (en-US etc) when developing we can set a default. For Mobile the API finds nothing and there is no way to download any handwriting packages in the settings. I tried both C# and vb.net","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160063389-ali-el","datetime":"2016-04-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/165415434-jared","datetime":"2016-05-08","body":"Yes, I too wasted time due to this missing feature. I wouldn't have attempted it if the API documentation said mobile wasn't supported. Instead, you get the impression everything will be fine for mobile. Coming soon* no doubt...."}]}
