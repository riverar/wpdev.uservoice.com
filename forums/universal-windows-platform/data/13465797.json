(Like Installing drivers for Hardware present)\n<br>Wouldn't it be better to Call this Firstrun-Setup once, and apply it to the base setup?","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158297565-alex","datetime":"2016-04-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158297565-alex","datetime":"2016-05-24","body":"It good to have a clean base image, in that case, what about running it once, and storing the diff in a separate folder, witch is applied on top of the base image before the normal execution starts?\n<br>My intent is to reduce/remove the setup witch basically does the same every time."}]}
