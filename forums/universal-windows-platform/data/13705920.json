While we can implement it ourselves, it does require a lot of work, and putting it in a XAML control would make life so much easier.","votes":"36","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/157900821-tony","datetime":"2016-05-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/892827313-morgan","datetime":"2019-04-06","body":"I think this should be like the ribbon in *Onenote for Windows 10*"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/337218778","datetime":"2017-02-25","body":"I started developing a ribbon control, but it is in very early stage. And as Thomas says, its a lot of work. Especially when it is downsized an small screen devices, how should the items be dislayed in a manner, that you can still use the control on e. g. Phone devices with touch. Costed me already serveral nights to think about. My idea was to create a own button like control, that can be collapsed to something like a flyout and displays a icon on the left and label of the button on the right, just like the office mobile apps does"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158611122-thomas-claudius-huber","datetime":"2017-02-18","body":"Classic line of business apps often have a navigation with a main menu and a toolbar or a ribbon control. \n<br>I suggest that you put a toolbar or a ribbon into the platform. Today there's nothing that supports it. The CommandBar does not have the classic left-to-right stacking of elements. So I guess at least you should provide a kind of ToolBarOverflowPanel where developers could put buttons, ComboBoxes and other controls inside and that creates automatically an overflow-menu with these controls."}]}
