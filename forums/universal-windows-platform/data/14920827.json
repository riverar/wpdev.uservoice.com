Sometimes I only have a StorageFile and I would like to launch the Explorer to display that file. To do so, I need access to the file's StorageFolder and pass that to LaunchFolderAsync. However, I usually don't have the permission to access the StorageFolder and StorageFile.GetParentAsync() returns null.","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52937711-markusml","datetime":"2016-06-23","comments":[]}
