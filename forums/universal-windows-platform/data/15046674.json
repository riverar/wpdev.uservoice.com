A GATT notification arrives from a sensor. We only get 30 seconds to do something with it.  We want to tag the location but GPS takes longer than that to lock.  So either enable longer running of tasks or perhaps some kind of callback mechanism after initiating a GPS request in the background.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/184671666-david","datetime":"2016-06-30","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2016-07-15","body":"David, just emailed you based on your UserVoice email"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/184671666-david","datetime":"2016-07-09","body":"Hi Clint"}]}
