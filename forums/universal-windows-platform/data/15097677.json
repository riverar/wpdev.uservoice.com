Currently I cannot access the handshake of the HttpClient where the SSL pinning verification should be done. I know I can get server certificates from the server once the request is done, but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the SAME request.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/17382733-guatamole","datetime":"2016-07-06","comments":[]}
