It worked fairly well on WP8.1, but now on W10M, when you go to the start screen, until the tile notification refreshes, the live tile shows the default app tile. I checked with multiple clock tile apps in the store and they all have this same fundamental issue. (blank or app logo on tile until tile notification refreshes). What would be nice is, instead of sending tile notifications for every minute, if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute. Something like what HTC shipped with their Windows Phones. In an effort to minimize overhead, may the system settings could allow for only one selected clock app to be running?","votes":"48","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/190635597-william-silner","datetime":"2016-07-13","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/285775589-shaun-joseph-chamberlain","datetime":"2016-11-20","body":"Dear Microsoft, after three ans a half years using and owning various windows phones, It's about time certain basic parts of the OS were opened up to developers that would allow for instantaneous real time updates to live tiles,or the ability to have a special type of live tile that can show the time in seconds- not just hours and minutes. It's such a basic feature of virtually all other mobile phone OS's. It's such a shame that users can't have a nice and glossy animated analogue clock with a seconds hand. Come on Microsoft, you can do it, it'd show off the OS via the start screen."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/190635597-william-silner","datetime":"2016-07-13","body":"Maybe also limit the API/Tile Updates to only occur when the tiles / start screen is visible on both Win 10 and Win 10 Mobile."}]}
