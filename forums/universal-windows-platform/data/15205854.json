But the modern WinRT network API which is based around StreamSocket, and the corresponding StreamSocketControl do not provide an option to enable TCP timestamps support. Which is not future-proof.\n<br>Yes, I know if we're C++ developers, we can use the traditional Winsock API, setsockopt() can do what we need, but that will tied us to the old self-manage threads model, which is not pleasing.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/191446416-jc-yang","datetime":"2016-07-14","comments":[]}
