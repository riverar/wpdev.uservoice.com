I would appreciate something similar for tiles as well. I know that IoT doesn’t support tiles at all. And some platforms maybe don’t support secondary tiles. I guess notifications has the same limitation (I haven’t check thought).","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/154469313-pekspro","datetime":"2016-07-14","comments":[]}
