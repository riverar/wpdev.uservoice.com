First of all, it shows cumulative acquisitions rather than for a specified amount of time, making it hard to compare which apps people like more (if an app has been available longer, of course the cumulative acquisitions will be higher!). Also, being able to see only some of the apps at the same time is very frustrating. I liked the previous Dev Center where I could compare multiple apps on the same graph, and just the look in general.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2016-08-03","comments":[]}
