This is very annoying for developers of good and populair apps. \n<br>A potential user viewing in the store will most likely make his judgement to download based on the number of reviews and quality of reviews (especially since the windows store does not show the total number of downloads). \n<br>After every update the default for current version will be reset to 0. So for app publishers this will be a reason to keep app updates to an absolute minimum in order to get as many ratings as possible.\n<br>So please make \"All versions\" the default. Or at least \"Last 30 days\". \n<br>And also remember the preferred setting of the user.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/82244077-jeroen-bernsen","datetime":"2016-08-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36734999-hong","datetime":"2016-11-23","body":"Concur strongly. This new scheme essentially punishes app developers who update the apps frequently.   I thought Microsoft had been trying to do the opposite - encouraging developers to update apps.  There used to be rewards for updating apps. "}]}
