At the moment it is possible to install to the application install directory, but the files there cannot be altered by the application. If the application copies the files to the application data folder after installation, as done in my work around, it cannot delete the original files in the installation folder, by this having two versions.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/216176628-hansjoerg-petschko","datetime":"2016-08-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/216176628-hansjoerg-petschko","datetime":"2016-08-12","body":"Hi Clint.\n<br>This is the thread I started in the forum before being told to give feedback:"}]}
