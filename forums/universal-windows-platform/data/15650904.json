Suppose we have an app with two modes like Zune - normal and mini. In the mini mode, the app only presents the indispensable and small elements on the window.\n<br> For the mini mode, the three buttons in standard size are too big. And for the consistency of the UI design, sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttons,especially the close button. I know maybe it's not at the Microsoft's priority list, but I believe we can somehow make it available.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/216847662-higan","datetime":"2016-08-13","comments":[]}
