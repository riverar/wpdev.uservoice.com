I can't find any documentation about these limits other than that article. It would be great if these limits are no longer in force. If I knew that they no longer apply I'd port the code in a flash to test things out properly. Maybe Rob Chambers or someone else on the Cortana team would know the answer? I can understand why these limits might apply on a power constrained device like a phone. But on a more powerful desktop system it would make sense to allow higher limits. Sapi can handle almost anything I throw at it. And I throw a lot at it. Like listen for all class names in my solution. Listen for all method names. Listen for all PowerShell command names. Listen for around 5000 possible commands in Visual Studio. etc etc. These are huge grammars that Sapi handles with ease, very accurately and with super fast recognition times. I'd love for Cortana to offer the possibility of supporting such complex command sets with as good if not even better performance."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2016-08-23","body":"That is from 2012, are you seeing an issue with this currently?"}]}
