That behavior is good but has changed in UWP (both now reflect the same thing: Display Language), making it unecessarely hard for developers to correctly respect the user's preference when displaying dates and numbers.

I know personally of a few multi-national companies (10 000+ users) that standardize on Windows clients with English as display language.

It is quite common that users prefer display language such as US English and that this is different from regional settings."}]}
