And sometimes bad bugs, like deadlocks, happens. And its real pain to investigate them, since usually they happen without debugger and on release builds. Windows 10 Mobile is like back box you can't get full access to.","votes":"18","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/91512799-yura-yaroshevich","datetime":"2016-09-04","comments":[]}
