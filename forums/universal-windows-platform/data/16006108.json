This works nicely, except when the SplitView is in Overlay mode and the user presses a hardware back button on the phone. In this case, the SplitViewPane gets closed, as expected, but it does that by seemingly overwriting the Binding on IsPaneOpen and instead setting it directly to the value \"false\". The effect is that the panel can never be opened again, as my code will do this by setting the VM property to \"true\", but the binding was already lost. Please fix this.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/237479758-bernhard-k%C3%B6nig","datetime":"2016-09-10","comments":[]}
