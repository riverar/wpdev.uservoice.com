As I understand it insider reviews that aren't on the slow ring are removed, even worse they're deleted permanently from even the Developer Dashboard. People took time to write thoughtful reviews and they're simply deleted. I've started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/241731706-mattias-homde","datetime":"2016-09-14","comments":[]}
