It is because the responsible HTML element c-heading class font-size style property is fixed to 15px. Please, revise that value to 12px, or provide better representation solution.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/160461816-bozhidar-hinkov","datetime":"2016-10-03","comments":[]}
