There are many devices (like a USB-Madi, or Dante Virtual Soundcard) which use at least 64 channels. These channels are not accessible with the current AudioGraph API's. This is a real problem.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/275675977-wouter-janmaat","datetime":"2016-11-03","comments":[]}
