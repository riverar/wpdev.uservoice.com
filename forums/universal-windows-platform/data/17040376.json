The Windows display language of my computer is set to en-US, because I am an app developer and most app problems and solutions are written in English. However, I am developing a Chinese (zh-TW) app using MapControl on my computer. Unfortunately, we can't set the MapControl language by programming to a specific value. MapControl always uses the Windows display language. It is inconvenient for me to debug a Chinese app with MapControl, while my favorite Windows display languages is en-US.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/280343407-meng-yuan-huang","datetime":"2016-11-10","comments":[]}
