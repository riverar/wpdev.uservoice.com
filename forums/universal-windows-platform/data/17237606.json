I know you have tweaked alarm volume in Insider builds, but you simply cannot cover all user need if you don't provide them the slider. Many users still complains about given volume, even fade in doesn't save the situation.","votes":"32","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/175425078-viktor-szekeress","datetime":"2016-11-25","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781910242","datetime":"2018-04-28","body":"Tassiouousayni"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781910242","datetime":"2018-04-28","body":"Tassiou"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781910242","datetime":"2018-04-28","body":"94110627"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/175425078-viktor-szekeress","datetime":"2016-12-02","body":"Hello, thanks for reply."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/169710942-windows-notification-team","datetime":"2016-11-30","body":"Hey Viktor, we realize that using separate files for each sound level isn't ideal."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/175425078-viktor-szekeress","datetime":"2016-11-28","body":"That's not very developer-friendly, to have 3-5 versions of all sounds for different sound levels. My app contains 60 alarm sounds. Moreover, consider the case when user wants to use his own music. In such case I would have to copy the same file in multiple volume versions."}]}
