Really the only big difference is the screen size, but you could set your window size to match that of a phone, and ensure it looks ok. The only time this wouldn't work is if you need phone specific things like doing phone calls etc, but you can't do that on the emulator either."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/98398725-nat-han-b","datetime":"2015-08-27","body":"I used to have an old PC with Windows 8.1 Pro but I couldn't use Windows Phone 8.1 emulator because of my old hardware (I could however use Windows 8.1 emulator). Today I own a more powerful PC with an i5 and 8GB of RAM, but with Windows 10 family. Although my hardware configuration support Hyper-V, I can't use Windows 10 emulators  because I don't have Windows 10 Pro.\n<br>As a student, I'm a little out of money and I can't stand paying again for an emulator that I'm sure Windows 10 family is perfectly able to run, for it is able to run Android emulators.
