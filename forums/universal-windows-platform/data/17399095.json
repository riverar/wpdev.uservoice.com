If i have access to the FM radio APIs, i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers, not the headphones.","votes":"45","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2016-12-11","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/177695205-rolf-van-kuijen","datetime":"2017-04-18","body":"Why would you want to be able to output audio to the phone speakers instead of headset? That seems more like an unwanted user feature, having audio through speakers on the phone when no headset plugged is ok.\n<br>For desktop one should be able to choose output though, but not on phone/mobile.\n<br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding the request."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/298844728-tony-james","datetime":"2017-01-04","body":"how can I have a radio party in d office if I cant play my favorite fm stations on a friday evening...?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/290797978-sam-peter","datetime":"2016-12-25","body":"Radio FM is very nice app but without loudspeaker (minus 10)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/290162435","datetime":"2016-12-23","body":"The same bug.
