As a long time WP7/8 and now W10M user, I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse.\n<br>With mouse, flyout opens on right click which is ok. But when using touch gesture, I would expect behavior known from WP7/8 - flyout (aka context menu) should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item. Instead in W10M it opens just when I release the finger. This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/175425078-viktor-szekeress","datetime":"2016-12-13","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2016-12-13","body":"Can you tell us what build of the OS and device you are using?  Would it be possible to get a repro?  They should have a 500ms delay."}]}
