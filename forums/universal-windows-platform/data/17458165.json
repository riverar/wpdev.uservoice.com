I am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to Android's startActivityForResult() using the page stacks, but I have no visibility into the management of the page stacks (BackStack and ForwardStack). This introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/296623378-michael-cress","datetime":"2016-12-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/296623378-michael-cress","datetime":"2016-12-15","body":"I am building an editor for a hierarchical data set. The idea is to support a \"drill-down to edit\" approach to navigating and editing new data. This is frustrating on UWP because the Frame.Navigate() methods do not have a similar pattern to that of Android's startActivityForResult(), which provides the framework to launch one screen from another, passing data to it, and have the second screen return a result to the first."}]}
