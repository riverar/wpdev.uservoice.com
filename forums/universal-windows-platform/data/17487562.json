A user may change his review completely, and the original response could become totally irrelevant.  Developers should be allowed to update their responses at least after users update their reviews.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36734999-hong","datetime":"2016-12-20","comments":[]}
