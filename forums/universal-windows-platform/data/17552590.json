Probably the biggest question I have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user. We like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent&nbsp;of Microsoft (or anyone&nbsp;but us for that matter) is KEY. I may simply be unaware of how this is done.&nbsp;","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/300886177-justice-frangipane","datetime":"2016-12-26","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/170319330-windows-project-centennial-team","datetime":"2017-06-06","body":"Thank you for your feedback.
