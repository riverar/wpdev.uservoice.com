Merging them into a single&nbsp;installer would benefit our users greatly. It seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a&nbsp;uwp and merge the two installers.&nbsp;The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access. Is ui access support on the list of upcoming features? Having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed.&nbsp;I would be beyond excited to get a response. It would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all!
