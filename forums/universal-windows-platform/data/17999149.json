If the list is alphabetic, there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter. But sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter.\n<br>I donâ€™t know what the component should look like. Maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to use the scrollbar. \n","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/65728921","datetime":"2017-02-08","comments":[]}
