Specifically, \"excellent mouse support\" means that menus will support all the hover actions that menus currently enjoy in win32 applications.  So if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu (without clicking), the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60848421-speednet","datetime":"2017-02-08","comments":[]}
