Unfortunately, the ScheduledToastNotification, which is just a ToastNotofcation but \"scheduled\", lacks this helping feature. This makes me, as a developer, scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not-so-relevant-anymore notifications in their action center.\n<br>Thank you.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/211286397-hamza87","datetime":"2017-02-09","comments":[]}
