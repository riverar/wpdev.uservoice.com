We can also change lock screen background. However it would be useful to get more flexibility. We could show users some constant notifications on lock screen - similar to Android lock screen notifications, it's really great feature that I use a lot and miss it on Windows. Right now to show custom content we have to set our own background and render some xaml on it, which is memory consuming and requires a lot of work. If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications, it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/19217957-tom","datetime":"2017-02-09","comments":[]}
