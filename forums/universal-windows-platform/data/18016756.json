For example, three quick touch strokes to scroll immediately to the top or bottom.\n<br>Really long lists and views are boring to scroll even at maximum scroll speed.\n<br>Keyboard have Home/End keys to scroll to top/bottom, but touch screen doesn't have same capability.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18548405-ipatov","datetime":"2017-02-10","comments":[]}
