Use case: As neither Groove nor Spotify have a lyrics functionality (anymore) I created a simple UWP app to manage lyrics for songs. I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now.","votes":"18","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/329043412-schumi1331","datetime":"2017-02-10","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/834308782-jani-immonen","datetime":"2018-08-13","body":"This is requested frequently by our RealDash app users.

Android has a mechanic like this that allows other apps to read notifications, especially since Android's media transport controls show up in the system notification shade. This could be implemented as a specific permission that has to be granted to the app."}]}
