The panorama control is still the best control for my app and my users love it. Updating the app to UWP is not possible without this control. The Hub control is not a suitable replacement.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18430401-sven","datetime":"2017-02-11","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14913141-hermit-dave","datetime":"2017-03-13","body":"I would consider both Panorama and Hub control out of date UI designs at this point. Like Panorama (WP7), the Hub belonged to Windows 8."}]}
