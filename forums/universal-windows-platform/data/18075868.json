One Scenario is that of a shoutcast source for Internet Radio streaming. A shoutcast source transmits MP3 data via TCP to a shoutcast Server. If a FrameOutputNode would allow to get the encoded MP3 data then that data could easily transmitted via a TCP Stream. Currently I have to save a MP3 stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP. This burden would be eliminated would MP3 Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode. "}]}
