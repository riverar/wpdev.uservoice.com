This is very useful in many use cases and can be done simply by a single line of code, formName.WindowState = FormWindowState.Minimized, in C# Windows Forms .NET framework. Very basic functionality that used to exist at the core for long. Besides, this issue was logged on Feb. 2017, and after 9 months is still not even scheduled/prioritized by Microsoft. Frustrating."}]}
