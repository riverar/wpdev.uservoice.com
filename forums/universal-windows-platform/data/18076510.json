The current options have the current drawbacks for me:\n<br>- To react on a NFC tag my app currently has to start which can be time-consuming and could interupt the user in his current task on another app\n<br>- The NFC tag is currently only recognized when the phone or lock screen is active. It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/330549337-t-p","datetime":"2017-02-13","comments":[]}
