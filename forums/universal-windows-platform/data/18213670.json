The root cause of the issue has been identified and&nbsp;fix has been rolled out. The framework update will take a couple of days to reach most devices as and when any new app or updated ad-enabled app gets updated on the Xbox device. \n<br>You could reach out to the users who reported problems for your app and ask them to re-install your app. The other option that you have is to push an update to your app (only version change) and push it to your users. This will get the framework updated on the end user devices and speed up the fix roll out. \n<br>Please feel free to reach out to us (<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"mailto:msft-aia-help@microsoft.com\">msft-aia-help@microsoft.com</a>)&nbsp;in case of any issues or queries regarding this topic.\n<br>Thanks for the patience and sorry for the inconvenience caused during this period.\n<br>-Vivek."}]}
