In WPF we could inherit the base classes to re-use the existing base functionality. But in UWP it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors, and the other classes are sealed. A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization, because it is so hard to implement in UWP. This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections.","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/54077101-lukas","datetime":"2017-02-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/54077101-lukas","datetime":"2017-11-02","body":"Alternatively, provide source code of e.g. ItemsWrapGrid or provide a reference implementation of a custom virtualizing UWP panel that works with ListView and GridView."}]}
