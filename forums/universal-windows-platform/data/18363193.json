PC apps are harder to find this way.\n<br>Also I noticed that in the Mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword. For expample  searchword \"Tinder\".\n<br>Is this new policy or is it a bug?\n<br>Thanks!\n<br>Best Regards,\n<br>Eug√®ne Schouten\n<br>(Qwabber)\n","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/333765697-eug%C3%A8ne-schouten","datetime":"2017-02-17","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/355333423-mark-turnbull","datetime":"2017-04-08","body":"Hello, "}]}
