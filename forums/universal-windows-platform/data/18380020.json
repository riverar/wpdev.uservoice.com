I'm using the TreeView of your official samples on <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView\">https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView</a>. The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF. So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP. It makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the TreeView.","votes":"52","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158611122-thomas-claudius-huber","datetime":"2017-02-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-21","body":"This is absolutely needed.
