Currently you can use the Pivot or there are 3rd-party vendors providing a TabControl. But as this is such a central control, it should be part of the platform.\n<br>If you build it, it would be great if you could add configurable close-functionality to the tab-header that is bindable to a ViewModel.","votes":"62","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158611122-thomas-claudius-huber","datetime":"2017-02-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2018-11-17","body":"Yes, Windows Community Toolkit has exactly what we need now.
