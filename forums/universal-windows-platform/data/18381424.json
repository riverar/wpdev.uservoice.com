A toolbar stacks items from left-to-right, and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models","votes":"48","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158611122-thomas-claudius-huber","datetime":"2017-02-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/785674432-yulia-klein","datetime":"2018-06-18","body":"Thomas, thank you for the suggestion. Can you clarify what's missing from CommandBar? Is item positioning (left-to-right instead of CommandBar's right-aligned primary area) the only issue making you ask for a new control? Or are there additional gaps?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36360515-martin-anderson","datetime":"2017-07-28","body":"There are the Application Bar and Command Bar."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/337167343-internetfreak","datetime":"2017-04-15","body":"Looks like a nice idea. Theoretically you should be possible to emulate this control using menu flyouts. Maybe you could also reach out to the UWP community toolkit and ask if they could do something while we wait for an official solution"}]}
