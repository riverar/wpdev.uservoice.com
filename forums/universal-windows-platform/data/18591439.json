Same code on machine with anniversary update, portal shows the string message in payload.\n<br>capturing events with xperf shows the message in EventData as expected, so I know it's logging correctly.  Something seems to have changed with loggingchannel, possibly default manifest code that handles the string message has changed around 15043?\n<br>FWIW, preview versions of windows post anniversary update were showing the message correctly.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/342795010-kevin-haney","datetime":"2017-03-11","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/362606887","datetime":"2017-07-08","body":"I have now tried this with Insider Preview Build 16193 (Windows10_InsiderPreview_IoTCore_RPi_ARM32_en-us_16193) and it is working."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/362606887","datetime":"2017-07-07","body":"Still broken with build 15063"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/388573459-marco-van-kimmenade","datetime":"2017-06-01","body":"Is this only a bug with the LoggingChannel?\n<br>I'm using EventSource directly and in the output the Provider, Task and Payload are all empty.\n"}]}
