That means while you are trying to keep up with the great UWP features you have to keep several VM's around.\n<br>It would be great if there was a service like Xamarin Testcloud for UWP devices from mobile to desktop which is a serious lacking thing for UWP and will help with older version targeting."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2017-04-01","body":"This is no different than Windows 7 or 8 however.  MSDN subscribers do have access but if you want an evaluation copy, you can only download the latest version of Windows 10.  The VMs we provide here were designed for development use in mind."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/339939613-neme","datetime":"2017-04-01","body":"No I don't, but since UWP allows to set both the MinVersion and TargetVersion for your app to run on a whole range of versions, it would be nice to have official testing environments for all of them."}]}
