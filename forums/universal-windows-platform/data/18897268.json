But a very important tab, Channels and Conversions, is missing. Including the data from this tab in the Store analytics API would allow developers to integrate their custom marketing campaign performance into their campaign management, and would be extremely powerful for developers doing paid acquisition.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/356544844-ben","datetime":"2017-04-10","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/356544844-ben","datetime":"2017-04-10","body":"That's fantastic, thanks for the response!

We continue to make investments in the scope of our Public API. As we build out additional analytics available through the DevCenter we subsequently enhance our API to attain parity. With regards to Conversions we've recently refreshed our DevCenter reports and will update our public API to follow suit. No specifics on timeframes but it's on our near term roadmap."}]}
