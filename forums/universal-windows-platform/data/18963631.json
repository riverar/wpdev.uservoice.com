I use an event to change opacity to 1 once the image is loaded and sized, and immediately I noticed that instead of just displaying, the image faded in with a 1-second animation.  This animation seems hard-coded into the style, so to get rid of it I would have to redefine the style.  A real pain just to get rid of the animation.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60848421-speednet","datetime":"2017-04-17","comments":[]}
