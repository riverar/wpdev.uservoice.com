The control would allow for the use of the contact picker, but allows for manual entry and deletion of contacts.  The control would include a field for required ContactFieldTypes.  This sort of control should be pretty much a standard across all UWP apps to maximize a consistent user experience.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/15328758-zing-pow","datetime":"2017-04-19","comments":[]}
