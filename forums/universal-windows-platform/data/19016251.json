Developers should have the option to opt-out instead of the option to opt-in. This makes more sense because it would annoy the consumer more if they have to remove the same notification in EVERY windows 10 device they own.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/116250459-colin-kiama","datetime":"2017-04-22","comments":[]}
