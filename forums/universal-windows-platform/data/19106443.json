We have an app that at times, adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl. Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority, if not all, were displayed. After creators update, we are only seeing a small portion of the MapIcon objects being rendered onto the map. And it's not because they are colliding with other MapIcons. We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons we've added.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/82071880","datetime":"2017-05-01","comments":[]}
