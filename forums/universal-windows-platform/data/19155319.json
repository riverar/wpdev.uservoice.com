Probably not looked in the correct place yet.  Even went so far as to chat, and the rep indicate that this not currently supported.  This would be insane.  I have reported sales information from many other sources.  They would include SalesForce, FastSpring, and Zuora to name just a few.  Thanks.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/367987054-brian-thompson","datetime":"2017-05-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/401178037-david-passmore","datetime":"2017-06-27","body":"Please offer an API for customers to obtain sales data more readily.
