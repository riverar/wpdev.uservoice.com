Because if you currently assign a Binding a VisualState setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself.\n<br>This will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to x:Null for performance (handy in complex screens).","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/177695205-rolf-van-kuijen","datetime":"2017-05-10","comments":[]}
