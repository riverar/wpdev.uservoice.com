This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish/must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions.

Fluent Design compositor should be available to Windows 10240  versions so we can delight users with older versions of Windows 10. The same way we ship in each app a custom version of .Net Core it should be nice to add a couple of libraries to my 10240 project and be able to use all the goodness from Fluent Design"}]}
