Because:\n<br>a) It is extremely slow. ResolveCompleted event comes after ten seconds.\n<br>b) It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders.\n<br>c) It draws MapPolylines in wrong positions (very, very often). They take right position then after manual shifting of map, but initially 20-30% of them are misplaced after being added to MapElements collection. Most often it occurs near map borders.\n<br>d) Lines on traffic layer are blurred, jagged and looking bad.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/76703529-leo","datetime":"2017-05-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/76703529-leo","datetime":"2017-05-17","body":"UPD2: MapPolyline may disappear (often) on map heading change and/or map pitch change."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/76703529-leo","datetime":"2017-05-17","body":"UPD1: Map fires ZoomChanged event on every map move unlike pre-15063 map.
