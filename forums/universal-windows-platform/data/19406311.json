Unfortunately if a task is launched via this TimeTrigger, but appears idle to the Operating System, then it is SUSPENDED. This means the task can not execute for the full 15 minute window. \n<br>If you either leave Idle tasks alone (they are Idle, so not using system resources right? Leave them alone!) or allow 10 minute or maybe even 5 minute TimeTriggers to be used. \n<br>My current Backgroundtask has a timer in it, which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically, do some processing then wait again. This low amount of processing looks to be Idle so gets suspended. Does not make sense that an Idle task would be suspended for not being busy enough. Making the task more busy (to work around idle tasks being suspended) would mean more battery usage, kind of the opposite of what you want.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59915231-stephen-price","datetime":"2017-05-25","comments":[]}
