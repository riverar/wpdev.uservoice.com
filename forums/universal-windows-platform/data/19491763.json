It's not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan/Shaban though which can vary per region/user (some users like to use the adjustment of a different country). The Windows 10 Calender app show cases this feature, with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri, a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice. I don't know how they achieved this though because there is no known API in UWP for it right now. Not for any of the datetime controls anyway (DatePicker, CalenderView etc.).","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/328387729-kes","datetime":"2017-06-03","comments":[]}
