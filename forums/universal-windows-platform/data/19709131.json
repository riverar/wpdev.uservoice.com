It has become difficult to both know what key you need to press, and get the timing of the press correct to be able to access your BIOS. It would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the BIOS menu.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/399644014-bryan-humpherys","datetime":"2017-06-23","comments":[]}
