I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree, or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree.  It would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that I don't have to guess and click through the tree to find an element.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/401153698-keiichi-yamamoto","datetime":"2017-06-27","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/401153698-keiichi-yamamoto","datetime":"2017-07-01","body":"I found that WinAppDriver can return element size and position if the app was not running in full-screen mode."}]}
