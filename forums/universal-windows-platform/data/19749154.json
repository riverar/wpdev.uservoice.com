I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching, so /context command is not provided.  However, the context switching is not required to support @WindowsFindBy annotated element.  It just needs the /context command that returns the current context name, which could be hard-coded as \"NATIVE_APP\". Then Appium will happily use the native locator.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/401153698-keiichi-yamamoto","datetime":"2017-06-27","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/743100352-mn","datetime":"2018-01-20","body":"Hi,  Can you provide Java example on how to use AppliumFieldDecorator class with hard-codec context(NATIVE_APP)"}]}
