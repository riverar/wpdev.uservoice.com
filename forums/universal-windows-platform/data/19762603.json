This is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the 'master' account name and password with lots of people, thus removing any value of using AD federation.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/370429618-marcus","datetime":"2017-06-28","comments":[]}
