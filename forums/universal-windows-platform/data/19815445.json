But for UWP apps to be published in the App Store, you must use .NET Native. Interestingly, Apps wrapped with Desktop Bridge do not have to use .NET Native. So, please allow UWP apps without .NET Native! (This would automatically enable us to write apps in F#, too, as a side effect).","votes":"16","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/402613726-eikuh","datetime":"2017-07-01","comments":[]}
