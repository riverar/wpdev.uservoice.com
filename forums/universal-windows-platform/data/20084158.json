It's been almost 3 weeks since I've submitted my request and I still haven't been able to get my app up and running. I thought normal UWP publishing was slow, this turnaround time is unacceptable. The way they treat their developers in the deployment process with zero communication and a long waiting period is a great indication why the store platform has been failing in favor of Apple/Android. And each Desktop Bridge app has to be approved individually?? This whole process needs to be sped up dramatically or I will give up on .NET app development entirely."}]}
