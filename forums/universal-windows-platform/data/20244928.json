They are very unfriendly to Machine Vision developers. NV12 and Gray8 are two basic formats, but they don't be supported. When we get the pure image data without image file head info, we don‘t want to chang the pure data. That\n<br>will waste in performance. So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat, like as WPF .NET Framework.
