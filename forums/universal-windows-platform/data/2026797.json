The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing! search.  Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.  If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available.  This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14310852-al-west","datetime":"2011-07-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14217019-simon-felix","datetime":"2012-01-31","body":"This is not a dev issue.
