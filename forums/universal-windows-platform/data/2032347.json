I would like to be able to convert my individual account in the Marketplace into a company one without losing my publisher name, my brand, my app portfolio and my user base.

The current way you are supposed to do it is to make a new account and transfer the apps however, if you use the Windows Push Notification system then it is not possible to transfer an app at all.  This problem does not exist on any of the other mobile platforms.  On Android Google Play store you can change your publisher name instantly and for iOS Store you can make the change with only a couple days lag time.  And on neither of them does it ruin your push notifications."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/45547858-pratik-chheda","datetime":"2014-01-10","body":"<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110711-dev-center-store/suggestions/5337075-come-up-with-an-alternative-non-creditcard-method\">http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110711-dev-center-store/suggestions/5337075-come-up-with-an-alternative-non-creditcard-method</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/43401494-jesse","datetime":"2013-11-19","body":"dev.windowsphone.com accounts should be able to downgrade form Company to Individual.
