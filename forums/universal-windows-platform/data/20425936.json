When you use x:Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView, this problem exists:\n<br>1. you change the value in the TextBox \n<br>2. you select a new item in the listView\n<br>3. Your changes from 1 are lost, because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus-event of the TextBox was raised. That means the change was never written back to the original item.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/158611122-thomas-claudius-huber","datetime":"2017-08-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-20","body":"I keep running into issues with UWP data binding that ends up requiring lots of code-behind to fix. The issue is best described in the below blog. This must be fixed to get MVVM in a workable state similar to WPF."}]}
