It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/436383022-david-mart","datetime":"2017-08-18","comments":[]}
