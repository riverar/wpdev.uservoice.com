However the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those OSes.  WP7 will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if I know it is okay.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14645355-drchemist","datetime":"2011-07-27","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37282280-ggon","datetime":"2013-06-14","body":"I think this is a topic that should be taken more in to consideration since most of WP8 users are bussiness users. As of now the only fix that have work for me is to Reset the phone to factory. This is something I didn't had to do on my Droid. Imagine all the stuff I have to loose every time I have to switch certificates. We bussiness users deserve your attention. Let us manage certificates on our phones."}]}
