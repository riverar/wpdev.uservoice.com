This would allow (as others have suggested) a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks.  An editor (like properties/settings) would be great.","votes":"31","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14813843-james","datetime":"2011-08-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/21469870-fill","datetime":"2012-02-28","body":"music"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/12859942-simon-darkside-jackson","datetime":"2011-08-23","body":"Yes being able to package this up before hand so that submission is pretty much a one step process would be brilliant, especially with the New Beta marketplace.\n<br>Possibly even an offline Package explorer similar to NuGet to view it by package as well"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/15328881-peshir","datetime":"2011-08-23","body":"Perfect idea. (Also for upcoming Windows 8 projects in VisualStudio, as there will be an app store there too.)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14086055-glenn-maughan","datetime":"2011-08-11","body":"I think this is a great idea. The new AppHub makes this easier by remembering everything but having to manually update the details each time is awkward. I've twice submitted typos in the description and having the details included in the project metadata would reduce the chance of this and make it version controllable."}]}
