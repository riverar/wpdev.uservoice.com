It should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily. Think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something. Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after 15 days if the application is not opened.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/12967734-ryan","datetime":"2011-08-22","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/17141062-praneet-loke","datetime":"2011-10-24","body":"I do not see the point for automation apps where user intervention is not needed more often than other apps do where users enter information once and that's it you're good to go. It is very hard to see the value of the current implementation of BackgroundTasks for automation apps."}]}
