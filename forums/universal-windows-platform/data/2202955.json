Launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message.  If the launcher isn't possible, a property would be useful for disabling/enabling buttons that start the launchers.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/15442610-bayprince","datetime":"2011-08-25","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37558311-ryan-gross","datetime":"2013-06-20","body":"It is a bad user experience if the user clicks on a button and expects to Share their link or status and instead get a bad flicker back to the application.  A few of the launchers present information to the user on why they can't use the feature, such as the PhoneCallTask launcher in regards to the SIM Card.
