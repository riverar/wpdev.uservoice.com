My suggestion is to make this interval configurable. For example, if you want to retrieve gelolocations frequently in the background. It is just not possible to do this at the moment. Other platforms (iOS and Android do support this!!!!!). Let the user decide what he wants (concerning battery life etc). Don't define restrictions for developers.","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/15608993-arjan","datetime":"2011-08-29","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27475435-moin","datetime":"2012-08-14","body":"Any update how to do this. It’s a major restriction. Also there are other constraints, periodic tasks won’t run when battery is low. Also no support on 256MB devices."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/23052009-mo","datetime":"2012-06-21","body":"There should be longer intervals as well: 12, or 24 hours. (Example: to update the live tile of a canteen menu, which of course changes only once a day..)"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/23358055-pro","datetime":"2012-04-18","body":"Yes, i also agree in this matter. 30 mins interval is a really long time. I hope that it will change soon."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/17173945-karen","datetime":"2011-10-25","body":"This is a must for applications that are geolocation dependent (that is, an app that wants to do something once a particular location has been reached).  The customers I am working with would be more than happy to decide whether he was going to allow an app to run more frequently (that is, higher priority than other background tasks) because the app will enable a group of users to do something they couldn't otherwise do."}]}
