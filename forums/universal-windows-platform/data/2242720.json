Currently Changing the stroke changes the color for the entire line regardless of how many locations are added to the line. Also would like the ability to make the Line a 3d gradient shape to have it pop out more on the map control.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/16194529-timb320","datetime":"2011-09-12","comments":[]}
