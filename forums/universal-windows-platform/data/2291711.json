So I would like the ability to configure a SIP client that ties into our VoIP PBX and phone system.. so my WP7 would basically become my desk phone (extension). The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.","votes":"83","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/16672572-kriz","datetime":"2011-10-03","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60777682-leandr-khaliullov","datetime":"2014-11-29","body":"This feature was present in Symbian and works perfect. My previous Nokia 808 has lower battery, but whole day I can receive SIP incoming calls. In WP8.1 Lumia 930 I can not receive incoming calls! On IOS 8.1 iPhone 5S I had set up Bria from Counterpath and works perfect as build-in SIP Stack on Symbian. On Adroid 4.x Lenova P770 I have got problems with microphone (no or incorrect noise detection). It seems thet Linphone and Zoiper got the same problems with microphone. My contacts can't hear me good!"}]}
