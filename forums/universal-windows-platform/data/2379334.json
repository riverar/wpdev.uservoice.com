Altough there are app like office, acrobet reader and many 3rd party apps which handles the particular content-type.\n<br>We need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using IE, they can choose installed application to open with.\n<br>Today application are achieving this by embedding browser control which is not a good expereince for end user.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/17522317-ashterisk","datetime":"2011-11-09","comments":[]}
