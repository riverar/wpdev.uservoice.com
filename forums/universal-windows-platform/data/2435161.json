This task could bring up the same interface when I share an photo from my pictures library. It would make it simple to share photos to facebook and twitter if the user already has it setup. It would also make it possible to finally share photos via sms and email programmatically.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/16144006-laura-reed","datetime":"2011-12-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/13086407-sandrock","datetime":"2012-02-29","body":"Yes!
