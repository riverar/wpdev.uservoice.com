It's quite frustrating to have to go into people, click of search and have to find contact, then dial. Easy when you dont have lots of contacts, but when you are managing Thousands of contacts, it makes life easy. Please implement. Thanks.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18965958-damionix","datetime":"2011-12-24","comments":[]}
