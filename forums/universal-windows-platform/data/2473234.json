This is a privacy fault since I cannot delete all internet stored data connected to this id. So I won't sell my phone. \n<br>For this I would like an user id (anonymous) so my data \"move\" to my other phones and delete from phones without logged in live account. There should be a random id instead after every reset.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18965993-code-ix","datetime":"2011-12-25","comments":[]}
