So I can't create complex HTML pages with a fixed header and a scrollable content. I will move the content per javascript but I can not because the touchmove event is not triggered.\n<br>Please implement the whole TouchApi in the Internet Explorer and the WebBrowser Control. This is VERY IMPORTANT for mobile websites because iPhone and Android support this. Please Help! Thanks.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/19008122-jt","datetime":"2011-12-27","comments":[]}
