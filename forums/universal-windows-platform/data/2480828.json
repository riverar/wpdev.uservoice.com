The last five should be frozen and any more than that should have to restarted. To close an app the user should be able to use her/his finger to flick it upwards WebOS style. in addition, the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen, a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder ","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18903196-coons95","datetime":"2011-12-29","comments":[]}
