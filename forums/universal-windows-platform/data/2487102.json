The phone needs to be able to have as much nuance in the recurrence pattern as does Outlook.  Otherwise, recurrence patterns get majorly messed up when displayed on the Windows Phone calendar:  Events that are set to occur every 4 years in Outlook occur every 1 year in Windows Phone and events that occur on an alternate calendar in Outlook occur on the numerical equivelant Gregorian date in Windows Phone.  For example, an event set to Heshvan 2 on the Hebrew Lunar Calendar in Outlook displays as February 2 on Windows Phone (Heshvan is the 2nd month of the Hebrew calendar and occurs in the autumn, not the winter).  These flaws need to be fixed for Windows Phone to be taken seriously."}]}
