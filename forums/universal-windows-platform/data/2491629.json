I have to redirect the user to a web site which will then open the YouTube app which will then play the video. After the video the user has to press back twice to get to my app. That's annoying. I would like to have control over the size, positioning and playback of a video.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14217019-simon-felix","datetime":"2012-01-04","comments":[]}
