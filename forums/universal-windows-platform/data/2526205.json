Don't allow ugly interfaces, be stricter on things like navigation, general look and feel, even animation. Give developers good explanation what they do wrong, and enforce good design. If something is unresponsive, it should not be allowed unless there is a clear and good reason for it.\n<br>Apps should take no longer than 2-3 seconds to start, and need to explain why they would take longer. Make the marketplace of the highest quality out there!","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18878834-phil-jay","datetime":"2012-01-19","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/23346945-raincast","datetime":"2012-05-07","body":"It's an interesting idea, but the boundary of rule definition is quite vague. e.g. how do you define which one's pretty or not?"}]}
