However, there is no category for publishing apps in such a category and most of the users react unintelligibly and give bad reviews as they expect a fully grown product. A demo or prototype category like it exists on Android would solve this issue.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/20783727-florian","datetime":"2012-02-15","comments":[]}
