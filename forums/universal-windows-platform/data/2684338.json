There's no way to specifically highlight the paticular place that we're wanting to show to the user.\n<br>At best this is unclear, but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we're trying ot show them.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/12933506-matt-lacey","datetime":"2012-03-15","comments":[]}
