Minimally it should show the CN from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code, along with the CN of the signer.  Ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md5 hash of the uploaded certificate.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/22313492-steven-osborn","datetime":"2012-03-20","comments":[]}
