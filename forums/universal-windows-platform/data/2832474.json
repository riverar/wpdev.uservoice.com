Pretty big design flaw, presents doing a whole bunch of cool stuff for managing alarms / calendars etc. I know I just did a test first project and didn't find out about this limitation until trying to implement the actual Background Agent, only way to prevent the code being wasted is to wait for this to be fixed or move the code to Android / Apple :("},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/19239677-mohammed-adenwala","datetime":"2012-05-07","body":"Don't vote for this entry...instead vote here:  <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-app-platform/suggestions/2832474-create-update-delete-reminders-and-alarms-from-a-b\">http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-app-platform/suggestions/2832474-create-update-delete-reminders-and-alarms-from-a-b</a>"}]}
