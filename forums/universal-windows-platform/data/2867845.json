I am doing Agile development on a business app and I need to let me boss test the app weekly. Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this. My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/24830423-david-rector","datetime":"2012-05-21","comments":[]}
