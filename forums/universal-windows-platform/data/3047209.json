Ideally these classes would be extended to accept a UserControl object that would be shown instead of the standard Title.  The UserControl should run in the context of the application that created the Alarm or Reminder, and as such would have access to the appropriate view models.  From there the application could be fully launched if desired.","votes":"16","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27114651-stephen-kazmierczak","datetime":"2012-08-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/55295652","datetime":"2014-08-17","body":"Hello fellow Windows Platform Developers, 2 years have passed since this thread and sad to say but this has NOT been improved until now by the Windows Platform team, please refer to this similar thread requesting for an improved Alarm/Reminder APIs:\n<br><a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/6281055-need-improved-alarm-reminder-apis-in-wp8-1-run\">http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/6281055-need-improved-alarm-reminder-apis-in-wp8-1-run</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/39286990-stewart-rogers","datetime":"2013-08-09","body":"I agree. If you have the alarm snooze button go off it should at least have a way to remove your scheduled alarm. It is not a good ui to have to press cancel and then another button to remove the scheduled event. Thanks"}]}
