Not sure why even having a web browser control if it isn't going to have full browser features (minus the tabs, settings, URL input box etc.). \n<br>Since Edge doesn't support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/424670809-johan","datetime":"2017-09-06","comments":[]}
