This way we can give a satisfaction to all who buy or evaluate our applications.This communication channel can use the Bing Translator to generate the statement in the languages in which the application has been translated. I believe it is a feature that will cherish Microsoft to customers and that demonstrates respect for the consumer.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/28071035-andrey-kurka","datetime":"2012-09-05","comments":[]}
