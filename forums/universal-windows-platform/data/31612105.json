Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off. I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found. Currently, the only way to find programs are if you type their names. There are no keyword searches. For example, type \"notes\" or \"note taking software\" and there are no paid programs displayed. This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it. If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge, this is the reason. Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store. Apps must be found by keywords. There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesn't seem to listen. Why not have a closer connection between that team and your team in solving such issues?","votes":"12","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/675096283-sanjay","datetime":"2017-09-25","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/917252623-sanjay-kanade","datetime":"2019-09-04","body":"Two years forward. Keywords are provided in App Submission. But keywords are not used in Windows Store Search. Just try a few searches and you will see only those apps come up that have the word in their name. So the keywords are not really being used."}]}
