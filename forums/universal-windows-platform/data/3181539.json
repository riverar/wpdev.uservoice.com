Sure, it should ask if the browser or my app is used for this link. Nobody in the world sends me WP links, they all send me links to websites, where I usually don't have a way to open the specific object in my specialized app. This is really annoying and would be so easy to implement. Also there is no security issue, if WP asks which app I want to use (browser or app). Maybe there should be a \"Remember my decision\" option. "}]}
