I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what they're doing. I would really like to switch to UWP for development, however, I'm not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win32 apps wouldn't have any problem just downloading from a network drive. Win32 apps still dominate because they're so robust and developed. To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/681791512-tyler-wandtke","datetime":"2017-10-09","comments":[]}
