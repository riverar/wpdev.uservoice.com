The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app. In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system. But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states. Why is it so? I think in first case must be fired ButtonPressed event too like it happens on phone call. Please add that capability.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/690665710-konstantin-prokudin","datetime":"2017-10-17","comments":[]}
