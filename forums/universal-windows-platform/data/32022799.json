Would be a lot more intuitive, useful, and less distractive then the current overlay. Example: Open the Mail-App, write the mail content with the pen directly on the (RichEditBox) canvas, text gets recognised -&gt; Boom done. Example 2: Open your favorite Todo-App, write a new task with the pen (on canvas), text gets recognised -&gt; Boom done. The way ink Input is currently handled is sooo Win32 ;) I know there is InkCanvas and Windows.UI.Input.Inking.Analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way. (By the way, speech recognition should be handled the same way). So come on, all the APIs are already there :) Give Windows Ink a boost.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/301382515-n7trd","datetime":"2017-10-25","comments":[]}
