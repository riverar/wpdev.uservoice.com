Even to suggest a path is not possible.\n<br>So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string. So at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:\\very long path..\\final_folder.\n<br>and thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder.\n<br>so this is now in 2017 after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative: change to UWP ?","votes":"19","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/123371589-raimund-popp","datetime":"2017-11-09","comments":[]}
