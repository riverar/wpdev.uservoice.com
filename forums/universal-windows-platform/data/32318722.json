This is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models. It doesn't make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-19","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2018-05-07","body":"Testing, testing, is this mic on?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2018-03-30","body":"Is this still being investigated?

Create a new UWP project targeting on Fall Creators Update and put the following in the MainPage source files. It's quick and dirty but if you put a breakpoint on the button event and watch what happens when the second view model is set, you will see the selected item is cleared."}]}
