At first this isn't an issue since the control isn't Visible. However, if you make the parent visible, binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-20","comments":[]}
