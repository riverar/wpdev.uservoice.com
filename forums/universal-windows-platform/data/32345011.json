However, collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree. The header still 'exists' and is keyboard focus-able. Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems I'm considering this a bug. Please fix it to support hiding PivotItems correctly especially during data binding when you can't simply add/remove it from the Items collection.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-21","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/747073891-alex","datetime":"2018-01-29","body":"use xLoad"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2017-11-21","body":"See also: "}]}
