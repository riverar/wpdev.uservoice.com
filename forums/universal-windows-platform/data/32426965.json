Please provide this same information on the 'Usage' page. OS information is not included at all on the 'Usage' page. While I get crashes by OS (Health page), I need to cross-reference this with usage by OS to determine the overall impact of a given bug.

At the moment I'm still supporting the original release of Windows 10, and I want to know if I can drop support, so it would be really useful to know how many people using my app are still on this version. At the moment the only indication I have is the number of crashes, but this may be relatively higher (or lower) on an earlier version of Windows 10."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/718596422-john-moore","datetime":"2017-12-01","body":"This would be very helpful in triage/prioritization of what to focus quality improvement efforts on."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/718585928-jonathan-edmonds","datetime":"2017-12-01","body":"I totally agree.
