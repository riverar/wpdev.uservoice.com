Also, the last used position for a given window isn't saved intrinsically.  Windows launch at random places on the desktop.  I understand this need does not really exist for mobile.  But for many desktop applications, specifically container applications, managing windows is a core feature objective.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/730996816","datetime":"2017-12-28","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/887615881-htso","datetime":"2019-03-08","body":"Without the ability of Window positioning there is no way to develop desktop applications with multiple windows"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/749372377-anh-lai","datetime":"2018-01-31","body":"I have same problem"}]}
