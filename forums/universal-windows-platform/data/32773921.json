If you are using x:Bind to bind that control's value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page, then when you press the primary button the property doesn't get updated.\n<br>I've tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler, but this does not help. Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/731703490-dean-chalk","datetime":"2017-12-30","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/279291349-harini-kannan","datetime":"2018-01-04","body":"Hi Daniel - can you share a repro of your code in GitHub that we can grab?
