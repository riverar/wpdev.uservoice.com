Why is the same not possible for the pre-release SDK?\n<br>On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025, but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing. I am not willing to go to fast ring, because this renders my laptop useless. I tried.\n<br>So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs, where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/734580631-jeroen","datetime":"2018-01-07","comments":[]}
