It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk. The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.  It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.  Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users.  And a user will just go elsewhere to get the app and end up downloading from shady app from the web causing them to get viruses as you won't allow elevated apps in the store. So in a round about way you're actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.","votes":"26","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/749177110-josh","datetime":"2018-01-31","comments":[]}
