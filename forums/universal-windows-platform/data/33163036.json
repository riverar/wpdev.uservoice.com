We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available. Now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files, which would have been easy with Win32 (just launch another instance). One of the problems in here is Unity code, which is mostly made to be single-instance, but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app.","votes":"21","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/749447263-ivan-zivkovic","datetime":"2018-02-01","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/103487703-adrian-alexander","datetime":"2018-09-20","body":"@Michael Would it be easy to switch on the multi-instancing only while developing?  And if so, then how?  My app isn't multi-instance but is multi-client.  It would be nice to test on a single machine w/o making a ton of changes just for that purpose."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/297085771-michael","datetime":"2018-07-18","body":"This is possible for UWP apps starting with the April 2018 Update: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/multi-instance-uwp\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/multi-instance-uwp</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/146526969","datetime":"2018-03-17","body":"I think it was shown for the upcomming update..."}]}
