The Surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a MIDI controller, but this currently requires installing a 3rd party driver, which is not a great end user experience. Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too, but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/701431108-parker-snell","datetime":"2018-02-17","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/887674465","datetime":"2019-03-08","body":"In order to send MIDI information from either a notation software program or a sequencer track by track to DAW you need virtual MIDI ports.  The existing solutions, such as Loopbe30 and LoopMIDI are very limited, AND they don't allow you to save your set up to a configuration file so that a large configuration doesn't need to be set up again from scratch when migrating your workflow environment.  There are also limitations on the number of MIDI ports with these programs (16, I believe) so that the instrumentation is very limited or that workarounds must be used in order to create more virtual MIDI tracks."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/701431108-parker-snell","datetime":"2018-04-14","body":"I'd like to note that the new APIs are broken - they return the wrong device names, and according to some GitHub posts, crash on sysex messages."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/777017263","datetime":"2018-04-14","body":"Definatly that would be so helpful!"}]}
