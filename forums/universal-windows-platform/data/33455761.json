We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps. It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox, which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high. Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/760549567-eoghan","datetime":"2018-02-26","comments":[]}
