This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.\n<br>For example, if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command, an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog, which causes an exception, if not handled will result in a crash of the application. In my opinion, developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control.\n<br>We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/761750281-anass","datetime":"2018-03-01","comments":[]}
