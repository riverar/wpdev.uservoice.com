The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand. The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display's say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally. These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251672257-anonymous","datetime":"2018-03-03","comments":[]}
