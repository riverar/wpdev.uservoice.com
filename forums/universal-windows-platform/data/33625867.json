I cannot expand FAQ entries and so on. The page above also recommends me to set up the MS Edge. The MS Edge is incompatible with my LTSB system. See <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/hardware-and-software-requirements\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/hardware-and-software-requirements</a> .\n<br>My idea is either to fix the Internet (I have problems not only with <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/\">https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/</a> but with some other sites too -- GitHub warns me to update too) or the MS LTSB systems (personally I am interested in MS Windows Server 2016).\n<br>Thank you.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/766384885-michael","datetime":"2018-03-13","comments":[]}
