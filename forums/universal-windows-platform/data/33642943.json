Now this is a mess. Intel says they cannot Give update. The Solution to no connectivity I have found is in Adapter &gt;Properties&gt; Configuration&gt; wireless mode. Changing it from b/g/a to b/g and vice versa each time it does not connect ; connects the device. I have to do it whenever there is some heavy thing between Computer and Hub. Microsoft can set a \"Do while loop in its generic drivers\" Also \n<br>2. please set some heat sensing app by default in your Windows before it is too late.\n<br>3. Set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations. \n<br>4. Let us make a different type of OS which can understand and not only communicates with the user.
