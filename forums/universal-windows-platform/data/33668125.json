Developers deserve a first class functional language to develop UWP apps in and MS had used Lisp for MS Bob way back in the day.  Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/767791015-sam-griffith","datetime":"2018-03-17","comments":[]}
