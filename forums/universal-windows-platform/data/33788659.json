He wants to debug his game real time, but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc.  Allegedly this works, however, I have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because VS gives useless feedback.  I have spent an entire day trying to get something, anything working.  if I choose device, I get a generic error (vie tried every suggestion I can find online), if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin, so I go into the \"for devs\" page on my device and I hit pair and I get a 6 digit pin.  that pin doesn't work though so the pin screen wont go away.
