It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk. It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin. Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don't block them completely as you're hurting both devs and users. There are thousands of apps out there that probably aren't converted for similar reasons.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/749177110-josh","datetime":"2018-04-04","comments":[]}
