Using an BLE-Dongle via HCI where it is(!) possible to set the min conncetion interval the transfer duration of the same data is approximately four times lower than with native BLE. So it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/778919422-frank-ertl","datetime":"2018-04-20","comments":[]}
