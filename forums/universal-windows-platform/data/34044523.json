Still today 3D mouses USB-connected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly. On the field, there are hundreds of CAD, industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a 3D mouse on the remote server over Microsoft RDC. Normal mouses are working fine, but 3D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from 3D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/780224374-ismo-talka","datetime":"2018-04-24","comments":[]}
