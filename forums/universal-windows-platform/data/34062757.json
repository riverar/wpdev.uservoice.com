Back in DirectSound, you could do L/R panning with any Wave sample-rate.  One of the benefits of migrating to AudioGraph is support for mp3 &amp; other files, but if you want do panning, you still have to convert them first.  Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode, panning other file formats could be supported?","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/780748957-paul-barrett","datetime":"2018-04-25","comments":[]}
