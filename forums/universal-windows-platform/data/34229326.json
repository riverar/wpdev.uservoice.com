In webview, we can do panning by moving with 2 fingers and zooming by pinching, smooth and fluid. However, we can't do the same thing in map control or in photos app. It acts just like using a mousewheel with increment and it makes us feel awful.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/166595928-maxin-inn","datetime":"2018-05-12","comments":[]}
