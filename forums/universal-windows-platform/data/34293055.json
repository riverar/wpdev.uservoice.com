They are a welcome *addition* to the API, but they should not be the *only* way to obtain data. When I've already created a dedicated thread anyway off the main UI for processing, I don't need nor want WinRT API's spawn even more threads. From now onward, please add Sync() methods first, and optionally add supplementary Async() method for long operations. Although the intentions of increased threading throughput are respectable, focus on writing API's that are foremost developer friendly.
