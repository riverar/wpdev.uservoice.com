I'm guessing this is a bug because it doesn't produce an understandable exception. If I add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediaSource.ExternalTimedMetadataTracks, the crash happens when adding the track. I reproduced this on Mobile Emulator 10.0.14393.0 WXGA 4.5 inch 1GB and on a Lumia 640 running 10.0.15063.1088.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/790148023-derek-g","datetime":"2018-05-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/76504311-max","datetime":"2018-06-30","body":"Look like it can be solved with\n<br>if (previousCue?.StartTime == currentCue.StartTime)\n<br>    currentCue.StartTime += TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1);"}]}
