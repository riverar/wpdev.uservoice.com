I suspect this has more to do with different selection modes.  In any event, there should be a read/write property for the node that is highlighted.  The ItemInvoked event can be used for tracking the last node the user invoked, but there seems to be no way to select/invoke a new node programmatically.  The use case for this is if the state of the TreeView is programmatically restored for a given path."}]}
