All I find is initial release date. No info regarding last update. I want to know what date it was updates, what version number it currently has, and weather the developer provided a changelog. This info should be mandatory IMHO.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/795134662-olav-r%C3%B8nnestad-birkeland","datetime":"2018-06-03","comments":[]}
