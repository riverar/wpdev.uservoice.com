This violates developer expectations. Since the SemanticZoom is subscribed to the BackRequested event, if I navigate to another page and press the back button, the BackRequested event is not called on my navigated page, since it is handled by the SemanticZoom in the previous page, even if page caching is disabled for the Frame. The SemanticZoom is kept alive because it is referenced by the SystemNavigationManager.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/311594887-julien-shepherd","datetime":"2018-06-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/311594887-julien-shepherd","datetime":"2018-06-07","body":"I have demoed the bug here: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArFisQhXHRSVq5sOkLs8EkA_dxKzcQ\">https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArFisQhXHRSVq5sOkLs8EkA_dxKzcQ</a> .
