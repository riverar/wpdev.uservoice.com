When dropping appx bundles onto the drop target, the page takes a long time to respond. Because the page doesn't change to reflect the drop operation was successful, I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target, wasting my time and bandwidth.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/183220545-rafael-rivera","datetime":"2018-06-08","comments":[]}
