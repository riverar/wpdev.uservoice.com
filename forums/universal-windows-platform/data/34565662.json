Using the touchpad/mousewheel, the scrollbar starts moving, but not the contents of the ListView. After a while the contents start moving, but there is no way to move to the very top or very bottom using only the touchpad/mousewheel. I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom/top of the ListView.  This behavior is not consistent. On other systems is works as expected.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/189335055-wim-bokkers","datetime":"2018-06-14","comments":[]}
