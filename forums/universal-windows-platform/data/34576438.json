This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items. Because of this, I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped. Previously, it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows' style (As mentioned here: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically)\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically)</a>, but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP, I am left without this functionality. My proposed solution is to add a \"RowDoubleTapped\" event directly to the UWP DataGrid class itself. I need this to be easily accessible from my XAML code. This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar \"ItemClicked\" event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781695193-luke-blevins","datetime":"2018-06-15","comments":[]}
