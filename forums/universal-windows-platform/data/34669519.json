When submitting a ticket it does not allow them to use their Enterprise IDs to submit a ticket, so a dev center admin with a enterprise id @contso.com is not able to login and dev center forces to choose a personal account originally linked to Dev center to submit an incident. This needs to be changed so Enterprise customers can open a support incident","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/818153053-anant-dimri","datetime":"2018-06-26","comments":[]}
