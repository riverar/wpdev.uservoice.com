This is a very nice capability and thank you for providing it! Unfortunately, if the gives feedback on your application anonymously there is no option to comment on that feedback or change status etc. I understand if the comment is anonymous then they will not receive emails on my comments, but it would still be very nice to be able to comment on the feedback and track the status for my own use or for future customers to see if they are perusing previous feedback posts. So, can you allow us to comment and mark status on anonymous feedback please? Thanks!","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/759945163","datetime":"2018-06-26","comments":[]}
