Binding in WPF the PropertyPath took the DependencyProperty itself as an argument, so you could do this.  In UWP, it only takes a string instead which will throw an exception if given a namespace.  It'd be great for the PropertyPath in UWP to also work the way WPF did and take the DependencyProperty to create the binding path from any source.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/706212226-michael","datetime":"2018-06-30","comments":[]}
