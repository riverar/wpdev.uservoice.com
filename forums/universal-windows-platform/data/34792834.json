This way as membership in a group changes, the license assignment for app will automatically change.  Currently, I can assign a license to all members of a group, but it isn't kept up to date.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/822371866-adam-gloyd","datetime":"2018-07-10","comments":[]}
