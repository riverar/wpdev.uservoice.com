I have been asking for this text tranform feature since the Windows Phone 7 Silverlight days, but even though most of the All Caps and All Lowercase text styles have been left behind in the Metro design days, there is still a need and wish to display labels, and other non-editable text content, in uppercase and lowercase styles, which exists in HTML with the TextTransform property in CSS.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36360515-martin-anderson","datetime":"2018-07-10","comments":[]}
