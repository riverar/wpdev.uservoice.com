This way the app is very robust and flexible.\n<br>Offcourse the api can throw CommandNotFoundException.\n<br>Cortana must already do that, after it \"understands\" the text, but i want to expose the api that does what happens next.\n","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/823411228-kkica","datetime":"2018-07-13","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/835086715","datetime":"2018-08-14","body":"cortana"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/835086715","datetime":"2018-08-14","body":"cortana.com"}]}
