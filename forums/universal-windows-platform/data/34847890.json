Providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios. It's awkward to have different means of resizing objects. The Whiteboard app, for example, resizes graphic images with pinch/stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios. Text boxes, on the other hand have little \"handles\" attached to use for resizing. With separate x and y scale measurements, both objects could be resized via pinch/stretch.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/824433511-john-alden","datetime":"2018-07-16","comments":[]}
