If an app has two components each of which have some important work, say saving data, and they want to take an extended execution session for that, they can not do it independently. The app needs to have a 3rd component which coordinates the sessions across all the components.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/689731597-psp","datetime":"2018-07-31","comments":[]}
