My suggestion is to add a toggle to activate the option, and a drop down to specify the time of inactivity that must pass before sending the money to the alternative account. Something like this:\n<br>BENEFICIARY ACCOUNT [ON | OFF]\n<br>TIME OF INACTIVITY (Specifies the time of developer inactivity)\n<br>- 6 months\n<br>- 9 months\n<br>- 1 year\n<br>ACCOUNT DETAILS\n<br>Name:____________________________\n<br>Email: ___________________________\n<br>[Everything else that's relevant to complete the transaction]","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/829392052-jeriel","datetime":"2018-08-02","comments":[]}
