Why is it impossible to get the Contact designated by the system as \"Me\", for the purposes of getting \"my\" current Picture? Why should I have to implement a ContactPicker to make the user choose, or implement the Live SDK and force them to log in, when the phone already knows?","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/13015829-robert-mclaws","datetime":"2012-12-30","comments":[]}
