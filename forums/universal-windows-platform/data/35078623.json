You can see this in the standard UWP demo, DragAndDropSampleNative, in its first section (\"drag and drop to reorder\"). Compare the behavior between the leftmost list (\"All items\") which has no drag-to-reorder and the second list (\"Selection\").","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/832996561-david-pritchard","datetime":"2018-08-10","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/832996561-david-pritchard","datetime":"2018-08-10","body":"Let me just add a little context above: I ran into this running Windows 1803, targetting 17134 SDK.
