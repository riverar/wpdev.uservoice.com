Specifically the height and width cannot be adjusted. Consequently it is impossible to, for example, make the Key Tip be square the way it is in the MS Office applications. The Key Tip is too tall to look good next to my controls. ","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/349517098-sjb","datetime":"2018-08-13","comments":[]}
