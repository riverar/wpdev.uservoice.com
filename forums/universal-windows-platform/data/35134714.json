The TextBlock TextTrimming property should have an auxiliary TextTrimmingPosition property which defaults to Right, but can also be set to Middle or Left to support the same types of scenarios but in the other locations.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/297085771-michael","datetime":"2018-08-16","comments":[]}
