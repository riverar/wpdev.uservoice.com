It parses the information by setting -&gt;Volume.Length to -&gt;Name.Length + 2, which must never happen. \n<br>Additionally, FltQueryFileNameInformation and FltPerformSynchronousIo cannot function on the file object, representing the particular folder.\n<br>The issue does not happen on subfolders and files, but only on the 5-character folder in the root of the protected drive, which is excluded.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/836384278-dejan","datetime":"2018-08-16","comments":[]}
