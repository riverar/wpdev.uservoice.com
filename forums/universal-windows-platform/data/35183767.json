Nice implementation of this feature is in the latest Android 9 Pie, where you can add your custom DNS resolvers and enforce DNS over TLS, or you can keep automatic configuration of resolvers (from DHCP) and use DNS over TLS if the automatically obtained resolvers supports it, otherwise use insecure (standard/plain) DNS.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/839299471-lukas-beran","datetime":"2018-08-22","comments":[]}
