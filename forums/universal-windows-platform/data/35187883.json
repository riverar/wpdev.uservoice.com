The user cannot click in the area to the left of the item's content in order to select the item - there is a \"gap\" that is filled by the expand/contract chevron, which is present for an unexpandable item but has its Opacity set to 0 (hence: not clickable). The user tries to select the item but cannot. This is a very poor user experience as the rest of the item can be clicked to select it. The user has no idea why sometimes clicking to select works, and sometimes doesn't.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/822893998-matt-grove","datetime":"2018-08-22","comments":[]}
