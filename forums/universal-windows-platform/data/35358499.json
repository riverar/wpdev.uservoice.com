The ListBox is full of ListBoxItems which each contain a TextBox. The objective is to support copy/paste of ListBoxItems themselves. However, because each TextBox within the list also has copy/paste, the Keyboard Accelerator is invoked whenever you copy/paste text in the TextBox itself. This breaks the ability to copy/paste ListBoxItems and ScopeOwner is unable to help you in this case.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/712591219-robloo","datetime":"2018-09-09","comments":[]}
