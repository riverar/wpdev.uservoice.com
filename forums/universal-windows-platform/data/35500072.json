ThemeResources inside flyouts attached to items in the sub-tree are not updated. However, it appears that if the RequestedTheme of the root element is updated then the flyouts are updated to follow that theme, so it seems to have been acknowledged that flyouts should inherit theme resources through their Target, so I suggest that this should be implemented. If they could also inherit styles with a TargetType but no explicit key, that would be very useful as well.
