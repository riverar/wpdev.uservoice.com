The closest category (the one I'm using) is Education. Here are a couple of examples: I can envision a mobile app that is a \"Tree Finder\" that provides the ability to identify a tree genus/species by selecting from an imagery collection, or an Astronomical app that provides ephemeris data (position of sun, moon, planets, etc), in a graphical format. My particular application locates earthquakes on a map and allows the user to receive additional detail.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/854085922-phil-nau","datetime":"2018-09-29","comments":[]}
