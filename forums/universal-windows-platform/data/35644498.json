However, the corresponding Windows.Graphics.Imaging.BitmapInterpolationMode enum has not been updated to include this value. Please add this value so we can use it in the BitmapTransform of a BitmapDedcoder method for getting pixel data or a SoftwareBitmap.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-10-05","comments":[]}
