The classic .NET FileInfo/FolderInfo objects in comparison are more or less \"empty\" and will delay-load those attributes when first accessed. If you enumerate all entries in WPF and access some metadata, performance is closer to UWP (but still faster)."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/211182684-gavin-williams","datetime":"2018-11-24","body":"Is this for real? Can we please have some acknowledgement from MS that they are aware of this issue and are working on it."}]}
