MS has abandon Windows Phone. My apps are now Desktop only. This was not my intension when starting development. I am now forced to develop Xamarin versions of my apps with .Net Standard 2.0. This will cost me much time and trouble. There is no Window device/emulator with a form factor below 7\". If Window will never again support those small devices, it is sad but understandable. But if Windows will support smaller devices \n<br>in the future, MS should support W10M at least for development of UWP apps in the mean time.The support of .Net Standard on W10M would be very helpful for me. And I think for other developers and users of WP too.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/860208955-paul","datetime":"2018-10-18","comments":[]}
