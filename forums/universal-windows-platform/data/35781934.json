Instead, the app crashes with a System.UnauthorizedAccessException. Going into Settings to enable this privacy permission prevents the crash, and the app works normally. However, there is no prompt to enable this permission as described in the docs.","votes":"19","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781695193-luke-blevins","datetime":"2018-10-20","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/914901577-ionut-popovici","datetime":"2019-08-16","body":"As of Aug 2019, has anything meaningful been done?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/12908297-mobilewares","datetime":"2018-10-31","body":".. also on (2) mentioned below - the other weird thing is in the App Settings page, the FileSystem access actually says it's Enabled in settings page.
