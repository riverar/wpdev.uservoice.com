After full access to Windows 10 API's for PWA apps, why we not run UWP applications like PWA on browsers as a cross-platform app ? It might be ASP.NET Core based and a convert tool for UWP apps like as \"Project Centennial - Desktop Bridge\" or \"Windows Bridge - iOS\" will be developable.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/861319975-berk","datetime":"2018-10-22","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/861322453-kirbey","datetime":"2018-10-22","body":"Good idea !"}]}
