I have been using the Windows.Web.Http.HttpClient for my API Requests. My HttpClient is a singleton. I analyzed the resource timing for my API calls with the Network Profiler in Visual Studio. In the Timings split-up, I see that the Waiting (TTFB) part takes the most time (about 275ms. Sometimes it goes as high as 800ms).","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/266740822-kumara-krishnan","datetime":"2018-10-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/878298193-peter-smith","datetime":"2019-01-04","body":"Can you please share a public URL so this can be diagnosed?
