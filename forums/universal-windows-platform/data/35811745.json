The preview in Azure Media Services \"Channels\" in v2 did not have the capability to do dynamic packaging. \n<br>This works fine if you use the AMP player, which will flip over to Flash and Smooth playback in a browser, but since you are using Windows UWP, you need to make sure that you are on the right version where Smooth Streaming is exposed on the Adaptive Stream source. I think that this was added post RS4. "}]}
