Someone _not_ owning your app can see the \"what's new\" section, but existing users cannot. Log out from windows store and vo√≠la, you see it. \n<br>I think this is bad design, how can I as an app developer tell my existing users about the new features in a release? The \"what's new\" section should always be visible. Personally I like to be able to see the release history too, as it gives me a wink about how active the developers are. Can't seem to do this in Microsoft Store, which is too bad. Many developers resort to copy the release history into the app's Description. Works well, but kind of wrong.."}]}
