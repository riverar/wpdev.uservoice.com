Support for these has been added in Windows version 1809, which I am using and I'm also using the corresponding SDK version. Interestingly, the lower level WIC APIs are fine, and also the BitmapEncoder can set properties fine. Please can this bug be fixed?","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-11-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880908958","datetime":"2019-01-21","body":"And just support HEIC/HEVC native please"}]}
