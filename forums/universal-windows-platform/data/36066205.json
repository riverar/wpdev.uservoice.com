It would be extremely useful (time saving) if the Docs site had a saved filter setting for this that helped restrict search results, API browsing, etc.  I think a lot of users waste a lot of time finding themselves browsing some Docs site page which turns out to not be applicable to their development framework. For example, I keep wasting time browsing through search result pages that turn out to be for WPF when I'm doing UWP development, and it's common for that to not be entirely clear at the time. At the same time, having all the Docs site pages show at the top which frameworks/platforms they're applicable to would be extremely useful -- and links to equivalent pages for other frameworks/platforms would be extremely useful.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/77798049-kburgoyne","datetime":"2018-11-20","comments":[]}
