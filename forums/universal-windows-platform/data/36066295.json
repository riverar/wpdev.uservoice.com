Other elements on the page ignore the StrokeDashArray property as defined in the Style.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/871901326-dan-meier","datetime":"2018-11-20","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-12-18","body":"I also have this issue. It makes it impossible to set StrokeDashArray as part of a style (assuming the style will be used more than once), which is quite annoying. It's quite a strange bug and perhaps indicates some deeper problem."}]}
