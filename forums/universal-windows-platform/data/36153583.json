It could take up to 5 days to submit and publish update, because If you submit small bugfix in Friday, your submission will be delayed until Monday and then it could take up to 3 days. I think, there is no need in manual certification more often than once a month or one time per minor version.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/104961126-oleg","datetime":"2018-11-30","comments":[]}
