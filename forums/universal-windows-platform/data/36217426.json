If I have an AppBarButton inside a CommandBar and set the Flyout of the AppBarButton to a MenuFlyout then it doesn't work properly - the MenuFlyout opens Ok, but it doesn't block the background and it's impossible to close it without clicking a MenuItem in the MenuFlyout (even clicking on the AppBarButton to try and close it doesn't work). This used to work fine before version 1809. Perhaps something got broken when the new CommandBarFlyout that's been added in 1809 was introduced.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-12-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/347595742-jeff","datetime":"2019-07-19","body":"This is happening for me too.
