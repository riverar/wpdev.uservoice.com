I have an open push channel and listen for events using the PushNotificationReceived handler. \n<br>When I receive multiple push notifications while Windows is sleeping (for example after closing the lid of the laptop), and I wake up Windows again, I will only receive the latest push notification via the event handler. Is looks like that earlier notifications are being swallowed. I'm not sure whether this is an issue with Windows, the notification mechanism, or with the push channel.
