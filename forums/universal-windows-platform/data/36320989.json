If the user is running Windows 10 version 1809, then the LicenseInformation.LicenseChanged handler is fired continually every 2 seconds (this did not happen in version 1803). It even seems to be called when the app is suspended which can cause it to crash. I don't know if you have to have purchased an addon or not for this to happen as it's quite difficult to test (the bug does not occur when using the CurrentAppSimulator). Any chance this could be fixed?","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-12-19","comments":[]}
