For example what if I want to make an app that can save music playlists or slideshows. The user might not be storing their files in the relevant library. If I can add files in the saved playlist to the access list but there is no way to know when the playlist has been deleted and so to free space in the future access list. The broad file system access capability does get around this but it requires the user to opt in and it also seems a shame to lose some of the security associated with UWP apps.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2018-12-21","comments":[]}
