I need to have a fully flat map. I know I can disable the user from changing the camera's pitch, but it is not enough.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/876791116-roy","datetime":"2018-12-24","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/823200238-duncan-lawler","datetime":"2019-01-31","body":"No, there is no way to do this. The world is not flat, and the map accurately reflects the shape of the world.\n<br>You can set the map control mode to \"None\" which will be a blank canvas that you can add a raster tile layer to and will not have any terrain."}]}
