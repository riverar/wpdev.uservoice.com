The tutorial says it that it should raise it as ProgrammaticChange, and yet that doesn't happen.\n<br>Currently on Windows 10 Pro Build 18309 SDK Version 10.0.17763.132 using Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.0.0 Preview 1.1.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/878371726-bruno-blanes","datetime":"2019-01-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/422709835-miguel-ramos-msft-xaml-program-manager","datetime":"2019-02-04","body":"Hi there! I couldn't repro with the W10 insider build 18327. When the text is changed inside of the SuggestionChosen event, the following TextChanged event is fired within the SuggestionChosen enum value in the AutoSuggestionBoxBoxTextChangeReason parameter. Perhaps there is bug on the docs. If so, can you point us to the doc, please?

The TextChanged event is fired well after you change the text in such a way that you can't \"bracket\" it with the ignore flag."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/822893998-matt-grove","datetime":"2019-02-04","body":"I've experienced the same problem.
