Using the actual hardware is okay for an in-person demo but the form factor isn't ideal to demonstrate the functionality to the whole room. It's no good at all for remote demos.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/32987622-justin-moor","datetime":"2013-02-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/127731432-mike-williams","datetime":"2015-12-04","body":"Good Idea"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/32917255-mikulas2501","datetime":"2013-02-13","body":"F"}]}
