A windows 10 vulnerability has been discovered - when an office365 user logs into his account through the edge browser, windows remembers its settings and it is no longer possible to clear the cache or log out. Even if you do a complete data cleaning, the Edge browser no longer asks for a login and password and immediately provides access to the personal data of the office365 user, and this is access to files in OneDrive, all outlook correspondence, etc.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/882357949-konstantin-sypalo","datetime":"2019-01-31","comments":[]}
