This is very difficult to manage in a complex app where StorageFile objects may be passed around, perhaps between threads as well, although the problem occurs with just one UI thread as well.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-02-04","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-02-06","body":"Hi Clint,"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68344437-clint-rutkas-msft","datetime":"2019-02-05","body":"Can you provide the scenario you're trying to solve here?  The APIs are, generally speaking, thread safe already. HOWEVER, only one operation that may alter the identity of the item (Rename, move, etcâ€¦) is allowed at a time. This prevents undesired, unpredictable results."}]}
