This means, when empty and set to auto-width, the dropdown width is very narrow and text for longer options are occluded. This behavior is different from ComboBox when IsEditable=false, where dropdown width is conveniently adjusting to the widest item. However, unlike winforms, ComboBox DropDownWidth property is not available for developers to fix it themselves. As a result, we have to change the ComboBox width itself or wait for the SDK fix.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/883193983-bas","datetime":"2019-02-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/883193983-bas","datetime":"2019-02-06","body":"Additionally, if IsEditable=true then programmatically edited to IsEditable=false, the ComboBox becomes unusable"}]}
