For some reason they want to use only UWP but it's impossible with the restrictions you've made!\n<br>It's a shame that running a desktop app is banned globally and u should let the programmer / user to decide if they allow run desktop app from UWP or not.\n<br>For me, this restriction means I'll never prefer to use UWP unless it's a must.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/883981948-izik-b","datetime":"2019-02-12","comments":[]}
