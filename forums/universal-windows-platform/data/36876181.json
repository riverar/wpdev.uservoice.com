The calculation seems to assume that the top of the ItemsStackPanel is at the top of the ScrollViewer, and if not the FirstVisibleIndex and LastVisibleIndex properties are completely wrong.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-02-17","comments":[]}
