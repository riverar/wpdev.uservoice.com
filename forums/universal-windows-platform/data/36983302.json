Audio troubleshooter tells me all is fine. Device manager says working but events shows it couldn't migrate. Have tried every route including the Mother Board bios. Have edited regedit entries, deleted everything audio and you name it someone has suggested it.  It can only be a driver conflict, this is a common problem I am told by MSDN folk, yet troubleshooter cant handle it.  Needs some attention.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/886358476-ken-t","datetime":"2019-02-28","comments":[]}
