The file I'm using is an uncompressed 5.0 second long 440Hz RIFF WAVE file, but the QuantumStarted event continues to fire even after setting the AudioFileInputNode.LoopCount = 0, calling AudioFileInputNode.Stop(), and setting AudioFileInputNode.EndTime = AudioFileInputNode.Duration.  The only thing that stops the madness is to call AudioGraph.Stop() or shutting down the application.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/879036916-steven-edward-wood","datetime":"2019-03-03","comments":[]}
