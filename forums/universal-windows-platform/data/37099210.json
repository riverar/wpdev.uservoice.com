Basically a Grid with columns Auto, *, Auto and a slider in the middle column. Dragging the slider thumb from side to side caused the layout cycle error. Setting a fixed width for the slider solved the problem. I'm using a UHD display with 150% scaling. The slider value ranged from 0 to 1 in 0.01 steps. It only occurred for one of several sliders like this that I had.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-03-13","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/858524038-jevan-saks-msft","datetime":"2019-03-29","body":"We're tracking this on our GitHub: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/477\">https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/477</a> "},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/891121855-martin-r","datetime":"2019-03-29","body":"I can confirm we've encountered this as well."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-03-14","body":"Some more updates on this bug. It happens when I drag the thumb to the right-hand side of the slider. I think that because of the way the template is defined, this might result in the DesiredWidth of the slider control changing."}]}
