Please implement style triggers for Windows Phone XAML (BAML?).

Without triggers only with Visual State Manager it sometimes needs to put many additional code to make simple things.\n<br>Also VSM's cannot be applied to styles and you cannot create a separate resource with VSM to apply it to different controls. So you are forced to override control's template every time and this is really bored."}]}
