When trying to match a file in a list of 1000 files, this is far too slow. As a workaround, I can use the path, but there are occasions when there is no path, such as opening a file on a phone from File Explorer and processing the NeighboringFilesQuery. Would it be possible to have a much faster implementation?","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-03-19","comments":[]}
