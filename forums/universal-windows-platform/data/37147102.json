If you use the LEFT Alt key it will activate the menu bar and place the access key next to the menu item.  If you use the RIGHT alt key nothing happens.  Either Alt key should trigger the MenuBar.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/327535057","datetime":"2019-03-19","comments":[]}
