This may cause that Frame.SetNavigationState will throw System.AccessViolationException which cannot be catched. In case the app is updated and the NavigationState is kept it may happen that OS is launching the app with the NavigationState from the previous version. This may cause that the app will hang during launch.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/23052043-v%C3%A1clav-dajbych","datetime":"2019-03-27","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/311594887-julien-shepherd","datetime":"2019-05-10","body":"I have the same issue, but the names are the same. The circumstances are similar. The app crashes when a new version tries to set the navigation state serialized from the previous version."}]}
