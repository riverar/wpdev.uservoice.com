I don't find any default implementation in windows community toolkit. Of course, we can create events to pub/sub but I think a common messenger system would be more helpful. I have created a simple implementation for this scenario. Any interests?","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/20818292-yan-xiaodi","datetime":"2019-04-09","comments":[]}
