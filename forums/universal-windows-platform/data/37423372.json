I don't accept the rational that sealing the class makes it perform better.  If you don't want the performance hit of virtual methods, then don't make them virtual.  There's no justification for sealing the entire class.

JavaScript does not know inheritance, and allowing it would have potentially caused problems when creating apps with JS. That is the reason why almost all classes are sealed, and why you cannot even create public WinRT classes as unsealed yourself."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/895513396-don-airey","datetime":"2019-04-19","body":"There's a great discussion on the subject here: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134/do-sealed-classes-really-offer-performance-benefits\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2134/do-sealed-classes-really-offer-performance-benefits</a>.
