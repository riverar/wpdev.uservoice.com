(I know how I'd do that running on an ordinary Windows  machine, but not for an app running on a phone.) That first example includes a lot of detail on how to write an app that generates events, but it's not remotely clear how you enable a trace session on the phone, and collect the results. The ability to generate events isn't very useful if you can't actually get hold of them."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36465635-oren-nachman-msft","datetime":"2013-05-20","body":"This is already possible today.
