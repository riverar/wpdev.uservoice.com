Right now CameraCaptureTask always saves a copy of the photo in the Camera Roll. If it is just a temporary photo for your app, the user most likely does not want this to happen. Then OneDrive gets involved and uploads that photo to OneDrive. Then it shows up on other Windows devices the user has. The user is cursing your app all this time. Then it shows up in the user's Photo live tile, and every time they curse your app again."}]}
