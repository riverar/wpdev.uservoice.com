Therefore no Event Id 100 (Boot Performance Monitoring) event is created anymore, which makes it hard to track whethter a boot took exceptionally long, etc... It would be nice if this event could be reinstated.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/880621351-werner","datetime":"2019-04-25","comments":[]}
