The UI freezing is the major issue I see in UWP and seems to not be improving, and I'm working with this platform from the first day.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/269151325-asier","datetime":"2019-04-26","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/215526531-micah","datetime":"2019-05-21","body":"Also, can you post this on the WinUI repo (<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml)\">https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml)</a>?

Perhaps there's a list of repeated content that isn't virtualizing correctly?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/54077101-lukas","datetime":"2019-05-21","body":"I agree that the load delay is something that should be worked on somehow. But if you have 8000 items on screen, then you have done something wrong, definitely. This is not something that an automatic layout system can handle."}]}
