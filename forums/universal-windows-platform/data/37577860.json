The app package should also contain any additional supporting binaries of the Windows service.  When the app is uninstalled ,the Services should also be un-installed. Currently, as far as we could understand, there is no way to capture any trigger when  a UWP app is uninstalled so that we can uninstall the service. Could you please add the support for packaging and deploying Windows NT services along with UWP app package and handle the uninstallation scenario?
