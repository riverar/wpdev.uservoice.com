Because there is no acceptable possibility to bring the app to foreground by itself. It wouldn't be a good user experience if the app starts working or displays a user dialog in the drop handler, but the user can't see anything.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/343195792","datetime":"2019-05-10","comments":[]}
