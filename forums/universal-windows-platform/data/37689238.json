Is the suggestion that UWP needs the GridView from WPF that you'd set as the value of the ListView.View property to get a simple table experience?  And do you need to ability to switch between the default ListView and GridView?  If not, then does the .NET DataGrid implementation for UWP apps meet your needs?  Or is this for a C++ app?"}]}
