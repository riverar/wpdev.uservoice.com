However, BarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventArgs does not seem to contain any such information.\n<br>It would be *very* helpful if BarcodeScannerDataReceivedEventArgs were to contain that information. Preferably an array of 4 points containing x and y coordinates of each corner of a barcode/QR code should be provided.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/901508638","datetime":"2019-05-21","comments":[]}
