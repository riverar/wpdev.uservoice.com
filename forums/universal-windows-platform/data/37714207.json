Right now, we need to launch powershell and run Add-AppDev.ps1 from the AppPackage directory or we need to run it while specifying dependencies. Since I can have all dependencies and the app installed in one go with a call to the script I should just as easily be able to have all the same things execute when I double-click or Add-AppPackage the app to install it. This silly script call is unnecessary. Support it but don't enforce it.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/901749409","datetime":"2019-05-22","comments":[]}
