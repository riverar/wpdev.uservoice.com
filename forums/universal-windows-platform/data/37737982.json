I use a MacBook Air computer so am there using MacOS. Therefore, I notice that, although I pay exactly the same as a Windows subscriber, I am not entitled to use Publisher? Why is this? If I am not getting the full service or entitlement of use, surely I should not be paying the same amount of money? This is not fair or correct. I would dearly like to use Publisher but am not able to because I use a Mac computer but still pay full subscription. Can you explain the logic and fairness behind this please? Thank you.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/902247286-john-milton","datetime":"2019-05-25","comments":[]}
