TabView.ItemTemplate only allows us to set the \"shared content\" rather than individual tab content. We need a way to set the \"TabView.ItemContent\" to a property from our data source.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/781695193-luke-blevins","datetime":"2019-06-01","comments":[]}
