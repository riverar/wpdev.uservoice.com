At the moment it is private (and inaccessible via Reflection because of trust levels), which makes unique contact/appointment identification impossible. Any application that might want to back-up contact/appointments (and thus would need to differentiate between entities via a unique identifier) cannot exist. Please take this into consideration and make the ID public (maybe with a new capability requirement).
