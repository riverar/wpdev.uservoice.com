Working with MS support, we were told only way to do this is to be able to add the following registry setting to exclusion list: HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\PerMonitorSettings, which is not possible.\n<br>Thank you for considering this change.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/908473294-ken-hallas","datetime":"2019-06-25","comments":[]}
