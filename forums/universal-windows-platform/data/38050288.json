When a search comes up empty it is not always apparent that the problem was leading zeroes. How about having the search engine recognize strings that are hex numbers and asking if the requester would like values without leading zeroes also included.   It would also be nice if there was an option to only get numerical values that matched the one being searched and not every single number that is preceded by a \"0x\"","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/909192568","datetime":"2019-07-01","comments":[]}
