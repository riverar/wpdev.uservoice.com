When the items are dragged over within the listview, the XAML infrastructure gives room (ie:- by moving items automatically) indicating where it can potentially be dropped. The current infrastructure doesn't have a provision to implement a custom air drop UI like \"Drop items here\" except for DragUIOverride. Having this feature would improve the user experience as it gives even more clear message to the users on where to drop when the items are dragged over.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/909571798-karthik","datetime":"2019-07-04","comments":[]}
