Shapes that can be changed anytime needed and with altitudes different to the ground level.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/909950560-izubiaurre","datetime":"2019-07-08","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/823200238-duncan-lawler","datetime":"2019-07-23","body":"This is mostly possible now. You can position a 3D model at an arbitrary lat/long/alt and orientation and update it as you see fit. If the model itself needs to change, you will have to add/remove which is a bit slower."}]}
