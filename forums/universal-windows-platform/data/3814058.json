However, many devs (most of iOS developers) are used to create native apps for many reasons (performance, existing code, advanced memory management, etc.). Although Microsoft has added support for native code in WP8, most of the APIs are not available to native developers. Either one has to use .NET to access a library or Microsoft advises to do a .NET app with native code in a WinRT component. However, that's exactly not what I want to do any many other devs think so too. We want native apps that can do everything .NET developers can do. Don't limit us artifically just because you don't like native developers.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27165535-daniel","datetime":"2013-04-04","comments":[]}
