I received a vague notification about this when I logged in earlier this month, but I haven't seen anything since.  I have no idea when to expect payment, what the status is, etc.  It feels a bit like a mystery every month, but July 2019 has been especially bad.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/911907934-travis-troyer","datetime":"2019-07-23","comments":[]}
