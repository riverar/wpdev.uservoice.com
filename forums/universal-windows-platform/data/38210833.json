With Windows IoT Core not even supporting the 3b+ yet, I have doubts this will happen. It's hard to convince my boss to use Windows IoT Core when most sensors/displays aren't supported, and that the most recent release is still targeting a 3 year old device.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/884894260-erik","datetime":"2019-07-23","comments":[]}
