Those are a nonzero value, 0, or a -1.\n<br>However, due to this function having a UINT as its return signature. You cannot simply do something like\n<br>if ( GetRawInputDeviceInfoA() &gt; 0 ) {success case} else {failure case}\n<br>As if the function returned a -1, all the bits are set. And since the return signature is UINT. The value will be 4,294,967,295.\n<br>Obviously you can just cast to a signed integer. But changing the return signature to a signed integer will save people some amount of time.\n<br>Thank you for taking the time to read this!","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/911930347-andrew-reinke","datetime":"2019-07-23","comments":[]}
