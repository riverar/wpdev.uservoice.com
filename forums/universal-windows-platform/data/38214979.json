It's holding me *******; running in the background, triggering my fans, etc. The only choice is to say OK. I don't want to do that without understanding what/why this is needed. There's a link to \"Learn More\", but that article is not helpful and I didn't see any reference to it being necessary (or helpful) for Mac. After a long online chat with Microsoft tech support, I was told my concerns would be shared with this site and that I would receive feedback in a few days, that was on 7/20, so far, no response. I'm not sure I'm putting this under the correct category, so I just picked one.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/911970178","datetime":"2019-07-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/916670482-bart-lee","datetime":"2019-08-30","body":"I am a retired lawyer. I think this is illegal. In my case MS first tells me that it will no longer update the MS-Word I use (fine), but then insists on gathering data from my computer. That was not in the contract. It blocks the MAC desktop. It is a nuisance in the legal sense. I'm looking for class-action counsel.  Bart Lee, CA atty 057592 ##"}]}
