This applies even if the files are locally available on the PC, the only thing needed to trigger this is to have the source file located somewhere within the OneDrive folder.\n<br>Moving the source file to any other folder (outside OneDrive) makes things work normally.\n<br>Please read more here: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=75384\">https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=75384</a>","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/912678031-dn-bianco","datetime":"2019-07-29","comments":[]}
