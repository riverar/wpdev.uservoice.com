Would prefer that Win10 Clipboard be BlueTooth aware - allowing paired devices to share clipboard (uni-directional or bi-directional). Useful for copying/pasting URLs or snippets of code.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/913024117-brett-s","datetime":"2019-07-31","comments":[]}
