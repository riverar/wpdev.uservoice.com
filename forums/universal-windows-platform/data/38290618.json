I don't like that. Candy Crush, for example, should never have been installed on Windows in the first place. Other apps I just tested for a minute and deleted minutes after installation. I don't want to own those apps anymore. Please enable removing them completely from my library. Thanks in advance..","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/913196842-breedtbekkikker","datetime":"2019-08-02","comments":[]}
