Since the database site for WMP 12 was changed about 8 months ago, from fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com to the current musicmatch-ssl.xboxlive.com, the Find Album Info function doesn't work. Rather, you always get a notification of \"No Match Found\". This function is very helpful when playing music CDs that WMP is unable to identify. And, clearly you folks at Microsoft have previously recognized its value, since it's been included in WMP for many years, going back to older versions. Please restore it!!! Thank You."}]}
