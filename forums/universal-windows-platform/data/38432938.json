With Windows version 1903 using MediaCapture.SetPreviewRotation() to anything other than VideoRotation.None causes app to run out of memory. This feature along with the UWP Class FaceTracker now appears to be useless if the device is rotated..","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/904133770-harry-bennett","datetime":"2019-08-22","comments":[]}
