Moreover, most of the apps shown are those with the Search Text in their name. Keywords and App descriptions are totally ignored. This seriously affects finding of relevant apps for me as a customer and is a major App visibility problem for me as an app developer.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/917252623-sanjay-kanade","datetime":"2019-09-05","comments":[]}
