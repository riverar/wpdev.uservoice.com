I just want to use a Geopoint with the GeotagHelper to get/set GPS info in a file. I don't want to access the user's location. The location capability should not be required in this case. If this is just a docs issue, please update the docs.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251695348-ben-stevens","datetime":"2019-09-09","comments":[]}
