If it does not recognize the record, or has no application to deal with it, it stops. There is no message to the user indicating what is going on even. The phone shakes and does its NFC tone, but then stops.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/35509716-nathan-hall","datetime":"2013-04-24","comments":[]}
