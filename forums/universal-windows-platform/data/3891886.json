We have developed a dynamic NFC tag that can broadcast NDEF Message up to 4 GB in size, and change the contents on demand. With this amount of space, we can share MP3 files, photographs, and other data that is typically too large to fit on an NFC tag. The problem is that Windows Phone 8 seems to have an artificial limit of 4 KB for how large of an NFC tag it can read. We would like to see this limit raised, or removed entirely, to allow for more creative NFC solutions to be produced.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/35509716-nathan-hall","datetime":"2013-04-24","comments":[]}
