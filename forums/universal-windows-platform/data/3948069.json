On my lumia 520 (WP8) i get jumping values of altitude, even outdor with a strong and good GPS-signal. The altitude jumps from 27m to 200m up and down, 200m is the right value. The values from GPS-accuracy are top. This occurs In both classes on WP8. I always use the DisiredAccuray = high! I have read, that another user have the same problem with WP8-Phone, like HTC. All GPS-App in the store have the same problem with the jumping altitude. \n<br>But i found a solution. If you take the  Geolocator class an set the DesiredAccuracyInMeters = 1; (Yes  set to 1), then the altitude never jumps anymore!!! Please fix the Problem in the WP8-SDK","votes":"42","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36172317-ray-krebs","datetime":"2013-05-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52455107-sidevanew","datetime":"2014-06-15","body":"still no fix? very annoying!"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/45611472-tim-jungbluth","datetime":"2014-01-11","body":"It's very annoying when using your (windows8) phone as a gps tracker.  Previous versions of windows mobile/phone didn't suffer from this problem; those tracked the altitude nicely and correctly.\n<br>Hopefully this bug will be fixed in an update..."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/39818625","datetime":"2013-08-25","body":"yes that is realy important problem! i hate altitude jumpings :(((("}]}
