My use case, as a parent, is that I really don’t want to give the kids a full functioning smart phone, I don’t want them dialing random people, I'd like to keep them in Kid's Corner.  I’d like to give them the ability to “Call Home”, “Call Mom”, etc. where I can control who they call, that’s why I wanted to create and share an application in Kid's Corner to allow me to accomplish this. This feature, as well as the feature here <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3326985-no-pin-option-for-kids-corner\">http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3326985-no-pin-option-for-kids-corner</a> would work in conjunction with one another to accomplish this use case.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36206214-carey-payette","datetime":"2013-05-13","comments":[]}
