I have had really pathetic experience paying the registration fees first on windows 8 dev center and now on windows 8 phone dev center. Tried all different cards which worked well on windows 8 store but are continuously getting rejected in windows 8 phone store. The whole experience of payment is horrible. Tried paying with HDFC, ICICI. The payment iframe for bank is not visible half of the time. Microsoft should seriously look into getting rid of Symantec for all these payment stuff. I can see numerous people facing these problems on web across.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36317871-manish-zedwal","datetime":"2013-05-16","comments":[]}
