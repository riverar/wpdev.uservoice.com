This is very problematic since if you need to do any heavy image processing you're slowing the UI and negatively affecting the user experience. It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non-ui threads (and then loaded by ui-thread image objects)","votes":"12","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37212607-mattias-konradsson","datetime":"2013-06-12","comments":[]}
