But now I realized that before I can test any application on my phone, I have to pay 99 $. I think this will be the wrong way. So I think it would be better to sell the windows phone and by a android phone, where I haven't to pay to develop applications. \n<br>I could understand that I have to pay, if I will distribute applications with the app-shop,","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37738668-norbert-gugu","datetime":"2013-06-25","comments":[]}
