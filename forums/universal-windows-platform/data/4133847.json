With GeoFencing in place, WP will know the location of every user at any given time. I would like to have a reminder system (API) that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend (location based). Example: \"Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time\".\n<br>Having this capability would Windows Phone give the edge of innovation in regards to being people centric.
