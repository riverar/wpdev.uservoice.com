Why this is not allowed is beyond me.","body":"Developers need to be able to use their MS account to sign into the VS2012 phone emulator. If it is a real account I do not see the problem here? We need to be able to test our applications with other windows apps installed. Even if they are only the free apps. Why is this disabled? What is the issue here?","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/38233820-taner","datetime":"2013-07-09","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/42636770-pepperdotnet","datetime":"2013-11-01","body":"Not to mention the usefulness of having something where a potential customer could actually try out Windows Phone and see how it works and if it will fit their needs before buying one. I don't have one yet, but I've been able to find out that email, contacts and calendar work well with my Exchange Server; and the browser works well, and that I will need to setup a SharePoint server so I can access Office documents on my local network. I can't test SkyDrive or Office365 without logging in. I would also like to download a few apps or game demos to see if they will be satisfactory for instance."}]}
