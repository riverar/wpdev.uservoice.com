My processor doesn't support SLAT so it won't run the emulator and get an error msg after installation. Are you guys kidding me???? You're biggest complaint is not enough apps with only 165k compared to 1.5 mil apple &amp; 1 mil android. If you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesn't only run on the latest and greatest machines. You've dumped off you loyal developers to explore other phone platforms.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/38525710-bob-t","datetime":"2013-07-17","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/13779608-templarian","datetime":"2013-08-01","body":"I think assuming a developer's computer is newer than 5 years is fine (almost every processor built after the Core 2 Duo age has SLAT capabilities). Requiring backward compatibility on such a small user base is probably not worth the developer effort."}]}
