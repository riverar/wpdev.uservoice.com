If Windows Phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team. Bugs like the \"other storage\" have been there too long and only get fixed in annual updates. They should have been fixed days or weeks after discovery.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/38636792","datetime":"2013-07-21","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/726447649--deleted-user","datetime":"2013-07-22","body":"I hope you don't mind, but I updated the title to be more dev-centric and reclassified the suggestion. Please keep the suggestions and votes coming."}]}
