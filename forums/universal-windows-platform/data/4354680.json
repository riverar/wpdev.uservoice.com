Apps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response. I'm aware that the Background Transfer Service is available, but there are cases where this is not usable, because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage. This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have, and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience. I completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness, but Windows Phone is currently too restrictive.
