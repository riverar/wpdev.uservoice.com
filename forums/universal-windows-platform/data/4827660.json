This happens when you try to scroll beyond the bounds of the control and there is the elastic effect which allows you to move the page beyond the border of the control. Would it be possible to disable this?","votes":"26","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/42464762-michael-stephenson","datetime":"2013-10-29","comments":[]}
