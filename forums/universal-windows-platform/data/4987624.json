However, since the original account is tied to my Microsoft Id (which is used everywhere else!) it is now a pain to log into Dev Center.  In fact, how does one do it?  When I navigate here I am connected via the expired account.  But logging out and back in is no good since I am not asked which account I want to use.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/43202147-vince-mcgowan","datetime":"2013-11-14","comments":[]}
