Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities. With an ISO14443 Smartcard support, you would be able to communicate with Smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via NFC Credit Cards.\n<br>These capabilities are well supported by other platforms and I would like to see this support on WP8 too.","votes":"17","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/43819258-raphael","datetime":"2013-11-29","comments":[]}
