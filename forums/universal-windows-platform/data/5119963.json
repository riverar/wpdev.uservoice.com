As Paypal is not available in most of Country and the rest option  is only direct bank transfer which is time taking process and also deduct more taxes. About 12-15 $ for every transaction and takes more then 15 days to receive. Some time even takes more. But Payoneer is faster and we can received payment in 2-3 days only. \n<br>Its my humble request to add Payonner Payment gateway for Dev Center Payout.
