Because not everywhere in the countryside or even in cities a good network connection is available. So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/44034733","datetime":"2013-12-04","comments":[]}
