When it is opened from a call, then OneNote can get information on the call details (Person who is on call, time etc) which would enable easier understanding. Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera, Messaging etc","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/45079532-sriram","datetime":"2013-12-30","comments":[]}
