I'm German and my English is not so good.\n<br>My problem is, I can use any calendar app, but the function goes back to the base calendar. often I have to make dates that returns 4 weeks on Friday or two weeks on Wednesday. In my old Android calendar is it no problem but in my wp8 is it not possible.\n<br>best regards and a happy new year\n<br>Karsten Klein from Germany","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/45088781","datetime":"2013-12-30","comments":[]}
