In the current view, I can hardly see the contact number or anything that I would like to focus.  If there is a way to change the Data Template for the list and details of a contact that would be great.  Also I would like to add more extension points to the Contact Details that are currently captured.  That I suppose is currently not possible.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/48541532-bnc","datetime":"2014-03-18","comments":[]}
