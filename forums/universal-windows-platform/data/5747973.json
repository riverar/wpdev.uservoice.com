However if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted. Or for instance we are in a setup wizard we don't want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/49503184-filiph-sandstr%C3%B6m","datetime":"2014-04-09","comments":[]}
