This makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant! Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me? Currently MS only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries (way to go in leading the way with technology in business!!) Anyway, Im sure that Im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/49597671-neven","datetime":"2014-04-10","comments":[]}
