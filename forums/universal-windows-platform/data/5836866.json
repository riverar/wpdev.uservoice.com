The new universal app model does not provide this functionality. This should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/19203933-roboto","datetime":"2014-04-26","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/133367199-roland","datetime":"2016-03-14","body":"Exactly what I need... I need the phone to keep the application running under the lock screen until some long running action is done (which cannot be moved into a background task).\n<br>In WP8.1 this was no problem. In Windows 10 I have just the option to keep the display active... but this eats battery nobody would need to spend AND the user can switch off the display manually and still kill my processing."}]}
