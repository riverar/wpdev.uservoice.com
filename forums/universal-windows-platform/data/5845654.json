I have a program that creates plots using OxyPlot with data the user can select, but because parsing the data takes awhile I do this not on the UI Thread and let my user go do other stuff. But I want to create a small sized image as thumbnail and send it to a cloud service together with the data without forcing the end-user to a certain page just to show the image a second and render it out and afterwards navigate back to where he was."}]}
