It is not a \"natural\" behavior and in some scenarios it would make phone applications act strange to [new] users. Windows 8, iOS, Android already support true multi-touch .","votes":"13","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/38082040-dan-ciprian-ardelean","datetime":"2014-05-14","comments":[]}
