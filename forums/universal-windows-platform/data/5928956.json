However, because the ScrollViewer uses the Direct Manipulation API, you cannot feed manipulation events down to any child controls as they are getting totally absorbed within Direct Manipulation code inside ScrollViewer. \n<br>Therefore, if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a Vertical scrolling ScrollViewer (for a custom ListView Item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example) it simply cannot be done. Once your scrolling, nothing else inside can react to user input.","votes":"12","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251669077-dean-chalk","datetime":"2014-05-15","comments":[]}
