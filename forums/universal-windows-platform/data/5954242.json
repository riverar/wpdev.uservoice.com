Short fullscreen video that reloads automatically,Just like Deskscapes for windows pc's.","body":"I would like to get Short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on Lockscreen. Just like Stardock's Deskscapes for Windows PC's. You get to choose what video you like and it plays over and over again,the trick is to not notice the end and the start of the video,easiest to do on waterfall videos... I hope you like the idea,i bet many people would like to have spinning earth,wind blowing,river streaming,waterfalls,etc on their lockscreen. Please let me know is it possible to do.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/51390092-karlo","datetime":"2014-05-21","comments":[]}
