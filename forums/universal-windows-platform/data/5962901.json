When you create a webview you simply cannot see the DOM or any normal information to see whats going on, what goes wrong and why it goes wrong. Platforms like iOS and Android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser. When you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop-&gt;Debug. And voor Android devices you open Chrome and go to \"about:devices\". This gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong (and with IE10 a lot can go wrong, IE11 is better but still not as easy to make cross-platform apps run like on Android and iOS). Having the means to inspect your app or site needs to be improved greatly. You can now only see the console (but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn't show errors), not even the DOM. Let alone inspect resources, timeline and html/css/javascript errors.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/51476882-martin-spierings","datetime":"2014-05-23","comments":[]}
