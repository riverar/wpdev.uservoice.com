For security reasons, I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi, then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone. Then, when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect, it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too.
