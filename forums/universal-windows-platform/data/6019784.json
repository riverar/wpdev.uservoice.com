And Windows 10 has provided a high fidelity VPN API to properly handle local traffics.\n<br>And, again, VPN users most know what they're doing.\n<br>So I suggest Microsoft should never consider this idea a good one to improve user experience, IT WON'T, in contrast, it will probably introduce something to spoil the VPN users' experience badly."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/191446416-jc-yang","datetime":"2016-07-14","body":"I personally vote strongly against this idea. Those users who will/did configure VPN in their devices mostly know what VPN is for. And give the app ability to know whether VPN is on is really a bad idea in terms of app isolation. How about an app behave differently if he know whether VPN is on and off? This would, in many scenario, indeed spoil the VPN users' experience.\n<br>I agree that some kind of prompts are enough to remind the user what action they should take to properly use your app."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/186571416","datetime":"2016-07-06","body":"Its okay "},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/169580358-khokon-khan","datetime":"2016-05-24","body":"Ntv"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/111712365","datetime":"2016-05-22","body":"Please fix this"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/169027320","datetime":"2016-05-21","body":"Fix this please "},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/166664064","datetime":"2016-05-12","body":"Neo\n"}]}
