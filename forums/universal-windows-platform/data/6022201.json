The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls. And because the same app runs on tablets and PC's, our engineers can work in the field, come back to their office, and continue working with the same data on their PC's.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52110654-chemcat","datetime":"2014-06-07","comments":[]}
