I think this is not correct, because using Paypal I can receive money in another country but I don't want pay extra costs for Paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account. \n<br>Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/25213816-sergio-castelluccio","datetime":"2014-06-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/63035125","datetime":"2015-01-08","body":"Same here.
