But when a developer submitted an app and it's failing for a reason/policies, it's worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his/her app.  What are the things went wrong, rather than saying your app failing on 2.11 (it's generic message) will be no use, as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies.  If you simply say an app failed with the policy number 2.11 or so, what can a developer benefit out of it, rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times, it will be frustrating.  After a little while, developer may think that, anyway they are not going thru, what's the point in spending time here.  Be responsible and give more &amp; specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.  May be this works with a firm/company, but for independent developers you are the source &amp; you are the helper.
