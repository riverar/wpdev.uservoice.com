There are properties like IsStaggeringEnabled and IsStaggerElement in the CommonNavigationInfo class, but the animations doesn't feel like the native one. \n<br>Thanks and keep up the good work with Windows Phone!","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/38681081-andr%C3%A9-nicoletti","datetime":"2014-06-23","comments":[]}
