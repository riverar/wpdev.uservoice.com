Control of music or video players is one of the first things that comes to my mind, but I am pretty sure that a lot of apps would make use of it. This could even be done without XAML, just by extending the tile XML format. Buttons would have a Task and a Parameter, plus a font or image icon..."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18392706-anonymous","datetime":"2014-04-28","body":"I hope I can pause or play music on live tilesã€‚"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/24851228-jean-claude-perraux","datetime":"2013-11-29","body":"Open the customization of the live tile to have a possibility to control the volume of the phone and other thing.

Or better still would be the power to create my own tile with a slideshow or app updates or app groups (apps executable from the tile itself) the size of the tile shouls also be user definable..  "}]}
