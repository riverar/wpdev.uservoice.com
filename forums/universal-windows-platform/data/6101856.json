First of all, on Windows Phone 8.1 I always get an IOException when trying to call PickContactAsync(). This is very strange, since I was expecting to see at least Contacts app to be launched, seems there's some problem establishing the contract. I also checked the Contacts permission was enabled on the Package.appxmanifest.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/51653018-tommaso-scalici","datetime":"2014-06-26","comments":[]}
