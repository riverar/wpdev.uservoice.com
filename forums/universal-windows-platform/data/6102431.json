There is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like Windows Testing Devices. Certain people request for devices and get immediately. Unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality. Any one here can see its down right nepotistic. I launch this complaint  on behalf of others and in good faith. Kindly i urge you to look at this matter. Thanks in advance.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52953679","datetime":"2014-06-26","comments":[]}
