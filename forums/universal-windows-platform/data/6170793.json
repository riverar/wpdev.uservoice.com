This could be used, for example, if you are developing an education app to support high stakes assessment requirements. Once your app activates this mode, users will not be able to see notifications, access other apps, or return to the Home screen, until your app exits the mode.\n<br>To prevent unauthorized usage, only authorized apps can activate task locking. Furthermore, task locking authorization must be granted by a specially-configured device owner app.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53701400-matthias","datetime":"2014-07-14","comments":[]}
