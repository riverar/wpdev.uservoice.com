When I have an image that will be zoomed in on, I don't want it to get anti-aliased, which is the forced current behavior in WinRT.  If there was a feature like WPF's RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode that supported specification of a nearest neighbor algorithm, it would fix the problem.","votes":"16","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/48304784-bill-henning","datetime":"2014-07-16","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/185900499-matt-haynie","datetime":"2017-02-14","body":"This is an absurd amount of work to implement this in Windows.UI.Composition compared to just setting the RenderOptions.BitmapScalingMode that was present in WPF.
