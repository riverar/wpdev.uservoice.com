Unfortunately we are not able to set the prices in both marketplace same way. In Windows App Store we can choose the price tier. For all countries prices are automatically set. In Windows Phone Store we are able to set the price for each county separately. We need this also in Windows App Store because:\n<br>1.    Exchange rate between US$ and € is too low. The rate is set to 1-1. Because we calculate our prices in € we have to change the $ price for all countries with $ manually and there are a lot of countries to change. We are not willing to charge less in US or Canada than in Europe\n<br>2.    Change exchange rate between Argentina, Indonesia, South Africa. The rates are too low, so we have set the values manually\n<br>3.    Checkbox to add additional fee of 13.9% on top of the normal Store Fee (percentage of Net Receipts) that is deducted in calculating our  Application Proceeds for these markets: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa.  This fee applies only to alternative payment methods (e.g. carrier billing) and not to credit card transactions in Windows Phone Store\n","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/44685173-triomis-gmbh","datetime":"2014-07-24","comments":[]}
