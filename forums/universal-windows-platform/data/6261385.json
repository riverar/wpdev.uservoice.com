This makes authenticating remote connections impossible.   I'm running an extremely basic web server from my app to allow people to remotely control the app over wifi from a browser.   This is possible through the StreamSocketListener but I can't encrypt it.","votes":"29","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52838102-gavin-greenwalt","datetime":"2014-08-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/78510057-andre-marschalek","datetime":"2017-02-10","body":"<a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d9276dd1-bb40-4977-98df-04a02f1d6cb5/uwpchow-to-create-a-tls-secured-uwp-ip-based-networking-server-app?forum=wpdevelop\">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/d9276dd1-bb40-4977-98df-04a02f1d6cb5/uwpchow-to-create-a-tls-secured-uwp-ip-based-networking-server-app?forum=wpdevelop</a>"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/233848081-john-petersen","datetime":"2016-09-05","body":"StreamSocket and StreamSocketListener (cause you know you need to add TLS support to StreamSocketListener!) require a way to customise the certificate validation (such as validating Issuer Name rather than Server Name) as the current implementation is extremely limiting when using self-signed/atypical-CA certificates.  \n<br>Use case: connecting to secure IoT devices with certificates that have unique Server Names that are not reachable via DNS, but have consistent Issuer Names."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/115672722","datetime":"2016-04-14","body":"its been 2 yrs now, any news on this one?
