It will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when you're in a meeting. At times, you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket, still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud, when you don't want it to. \n<br>Thanks!
