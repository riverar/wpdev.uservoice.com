If I understand correctly, this is not currently possible. Would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it?","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/55086727-mike","datetime":"2014-08-12","comments":[]}
