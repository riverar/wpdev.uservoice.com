In WPF you could inherit from this class to make your own. Please allow this in winRT! This is such a simple addition it's not even funny. It would probably take about two minutes to code this feature in.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/55621238-alexkven","datetime":"2014-08-23","comments":[]}
