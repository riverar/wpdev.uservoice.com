Clearly, \"Your tax profile is not valid.\" is not much of a useful error message. Even our tax adviser finally had no idea how to deal with that. We had to go through Symantec tech support chat, Microsoft tech support chat, and finally Windows Store support chat who had to look up the error for a few days in order to finally get an idea what's wrong.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/56135751-nick-pr%C3%BChs","datetime":"2014-09-03","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/22801874-iakovos","datetime":"2014-10-28","body":"+1 vote for this idea.\n<br>Also add the following feature please:\n<br>-View only (not edit by erasing everything)"}]}
