Many native libraries have optimized asm code written in different syntaxes and if(I think with a high probability) VS not support such syntax then if you can rewrite that code or if you can't use slower code and this maybe will be bad for user experience and for battery life.\n<br>Currently VS have tools such as armasm which can compile working THUMB code for ARM devices. But if you want to build, link and rebuild on updates such code together with your application then you must to create custom build tool. The question here is: \"Why developer not have buil-in tools to do that?\". And even if you will create such build tool then you will be not able(or I'm don't know how to do it) to debug such source files. And of course no highlighting, no intellisense is available which can highly help to develop in asm. Also you can ask \"Why I need to use asm when I have intrinsic functions?\" and my answer will be \"Because it's faster(up to 2x) and much more predicatable(because I have no guarantee that compiler will generate better code than I can write by hands or code that is already exists) than intrinsics.\".","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/56256065-alexander","datetime":"2014-09-05","comments":[]}
