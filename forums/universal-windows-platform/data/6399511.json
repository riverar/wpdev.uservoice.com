{"id":"6399511","link":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/6399511-devcenter-app","title":"Devcenter App","body":"Well I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does)  Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps. And if possible add the ability to connect to the pubcenter as well, or make a 2nd app to handle that. Although I do like the idea of being able to see both the download, and advertising stats for an app at once/one screen or easily go between the two.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/56279515-kyle-weir","datetime":"2014-09-05","comments":[]}
