Too many times when my PC has woken up w/the emulator running the emulator's date/time is stuck from when the PC went to sleep. The incorrect date/time on the emulator can negatively impact external api calls when debugging on theh emulator.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/15076706-andrewlong","datetime":"2014-09-13","comments":[]}
