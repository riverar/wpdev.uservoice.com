That the store would realize that it was my account and allow me to download it, as a trial (which would always start from the date I download it), if I uninstalled it and re-installed it would still show as trial. Then would let me test the purchasing as well (which would then switch the license temporarily for say 24hours or that run of the app). This would allow me to test that everything is working properly with the store live. ","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/56279515-kyle-weir","datetime":"2014-09-18","comments":[]}
