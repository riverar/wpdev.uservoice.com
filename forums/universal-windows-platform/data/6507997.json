For this, I hope you could add the uninstall rate, usage (how often, how long a user uses my app), etc. Maybe just add the reports Android developers have in the Google Play Store.

It is possible to do it yourself or use openSource tools. But it would be nice to have official and thereby nice integration into dev-overview."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/64245327-hector","datetime":"2015-01-28","body":"Yeah, there are many things that can be added to the reports, but some are specially useful, like knowing install base, no just how many downloads.
