Please extend this to be the Maximum time that the Bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection (which is 32 seconds), or atleast make it greater than 6 seconds so that very low power Bluetooth devices can be made.  The phone can manually initiate a connection with greater values, but the background task won't automatically reconnect.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57345056-carl-schwarz","datetime":"2014-10-02","comments":[]}
