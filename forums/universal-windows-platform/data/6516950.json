We ran into an issue that's not re-creatable on any device that we tested on and somehow was crash-failing on the same device in the certification process. This can go with the suggestion to allow direct contact with the tester of the app.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57703073-aplced-htwoo","datetime":"2014-10-03","comments":[]}
