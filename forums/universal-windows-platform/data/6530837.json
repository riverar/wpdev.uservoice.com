So that work is done. AMD though doesn't yet have  GPU addon. They went their own route with their newish  GPUOpen. I put a feature request in with NVIDIA to add support for AMD and other GPU vendors. They do have 3 others listed under \"Supported GPUs\".  As for number 2. You can download those now and they work so not sure what you mean by \"more support\". If there's something you can do in Linux that you can't in Windows, spell out exactly what functionality isn't supported in DETAIL. This will help MS know what actually needs doing instead of some vague ask. 3.) Not sure if that's the path to go down, try Alexa or Google instead. 4.) you want open-source Windows, because that's the only way to get what you want for Hyper-V."}]}
