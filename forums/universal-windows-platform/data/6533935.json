In landscape, the CommandBar cannot be minimized to â€¦, while it can be in portrait. I feel that it is important to be able to minimize the CommandBar in Windows Phone apps because there is limited screenspace, so even something like the CommandBar can make a difference.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2014-10-07","comments":[]}
