In certain circumstances, this makes the control unusable as one cannot differentiate between different items in the list. In Internet Explorer on the same device, the menu items wrap as expected.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57986361-dan-p","datetime":"2014-10-08","comments":[]}
