Any email client, except the one on my phone, recognizes when I've read an email on another device it will mark that one as read. My phone won't do that, because it handles these options in a strange way. On receive of an email, it sets an option, that any other mail client will mark that one as read even if you haven't done so. Well on my phone the mail is marked as unread.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58037252","datetime":"2014-10-09","comments":[]}
