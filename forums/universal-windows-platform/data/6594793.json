However, even the HighPriority data typically takes at least one minute to roam to other devices. This is way too slow, data needs to arrive within few seconds. With Apple fronting Continuity, we need a simple way to do the same on the Windows platform to be able to compete!","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/54077101-lukas","datetime":"2014-10-22","comments":[]}
