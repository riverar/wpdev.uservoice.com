Obviously sometimes it should be considered per sections - like if you don't have any localized pic, default pics are shown, but if you have at least one then those local versions are shown.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/58996385-ivan-i%C4%8Din","datetime":"2014-11-05","comments":[]}
