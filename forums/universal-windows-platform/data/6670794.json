Great stuff.\n<br>Now, since Cortana does this already, please pass us the parsed NLP string, with identified pronouns, with grammatical breakdown.  This must already be done anyway, so just give it us so that we can gain the advantage of its use without having to create the same in our apps.\n<br>Pronoun identification alone would give us so much context, but grammatical breakdown would also assist.  This would put Windows so far above the competition it isn't funny, and should already be available (we already see that breakdown when we speak strings in the near-realtime parsing feedback)\n<br>Thanks, a loyal Windows developer.\n<br>-e\n<br>(fellow devs, please vote for this one)","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59346828","datetime":"2014-11-05","comments":[]}
