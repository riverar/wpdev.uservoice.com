Then the data usually aligns such that one can select it such that the data of interest is within a reticle.  This feature is especially important when dealing with small sets of non-normalized data derived from sundry uncontrollable sources.  With the feature, a column of data may then be selected from a modified copy of a source document and pasted into a spreadsheet where it may be acted upon more efficiently than using a parsing scheme.  These needs which frequent themselves  fall below a benefit/cost requirement pitting the time needed to configure a parse.  So how about making such a capability global in the forth coming distribution of Windows 10? \n","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59515187-gregory-w-johnson-microsoft-partner","datetime":"2014-11-06","comments":[]}
