When the foreground mic/audio app stops its access, the background audio automatically resumes.","votes":"8","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59543451-mark-jones","datetime":"2014-11-07","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59543451-mark-jones","datetime":"2014-11-07","body":"BTW: This applies primarily to WP8.1 RT -- left Silverlight in the rearview mirror some time ago.  It may also apply to W8.1 RT, although I'm currently not interested in using speech recognition there because of the complete lack of native support.
