Windows 8.1 Store does support it. This makes creating Universal Apps difficult that need this service. The only workaround I know is using a old Silverlight app for WP. There WCF is supported. But then supporting both versions of the App is much more work.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53155935-loki","datetime":"2014-11-25","comments":[]}
