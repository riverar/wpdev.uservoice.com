I usually have to copy and paste data from a certain area and then paste into different areas.  If I can copy like say 4 - 10 different files/folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste, I would like to see a Paste - All, Paste select \"which would have check boxes on each folder/file I have selected to copy.  That way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere.  I know it could be rediculouse if you selected a lot of files but make a limit and if you select all then all gets pasted no matter what the limit is...","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/61162173-daren-handy","datetime":"2014-12-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/61168140","datetime":"2014-12-05","body":"good idea!"}]}
