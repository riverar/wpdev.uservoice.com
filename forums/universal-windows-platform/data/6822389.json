This is a very nice feature!\n<br>Unfortunately, there doesn't exist an API to do the same for tasks (todo-items). The build-in calendar-app only presents tasks from Exchange- or Outlook.com-accounts.\n<br>It would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks / todos to the OS.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/61366355-gregor","datetime":"2014-12-09","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/59713912-leandro-souza","datetime":"2015-01-11","body":"I'm not believing! \n<br>I can't managing my task list using C# code."}]}
