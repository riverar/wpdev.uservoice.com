I don't currently have plans to come back, however, the agent told me that if I do ever return I cannot use the same email address.  I understand that you don't want someone opening and closing accounts frequently, but I've used this email address for 15+ years and if I do decide to return to develop for the platform I hope that you support this in the future as I won't want to create a bogus email just to sign up!  Perhaps ensuring a 1 year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/61789096-ron","datetime":"2014-12-16","comments":[]}
