I have, in multiple scenarios, had to create a ControlTemplate to avoid displaying the Delete Button. I think there should be a property (maybe something like ShowDeleteButton) that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed. This property would have values Show, Hide, and Auto (or maybe a nullable Boolean).","votes":"10","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2015-01-06","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37957293-jean-marc-duperron","datetime":"2016-06-11","body":"I would like when you add a new feature like this on a old control, to have the possibility to show/hide this new feature.  I like this new feature, but I do not want to have to rewrite the template to remove it.  I just want in some case to be able to collapse it when I need.  This would be helpful for every programmer."}]}
