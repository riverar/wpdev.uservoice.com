So, please expand winforms so that legacy app developers can develop for newer platforms and easily make apps available for newer devices(and can port their winform apps to mobile and tabs easily).\n<br>Microsoft instead of developing upon existing technologies is too hasty to bring out new ones. This brings up a huge learning curve for developers. Eg. Microsoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into .net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead, now how will a developer who has invested lots of his time in learning NHibernate has to now restart with EntityFramework.\n<br>We as developers have to constantly learn new techs rather than solving problems. We are always in a fear regarding when Microsoft might bring out something new and will forget about existing technologies and all our hard work put into mastering those technologies goes down the drain. \n","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/63485563-hk","datetime":"2015-01-16","comments":[]}
