A couple of weeks ago, a few versions generated large numbers of crash reports. When I download the excel sheet, it only shows crashes from old verions (11 rows). I know my app is still crashing, but since it is crashing less frequently than it used to, none of the recent crashes are frequent enough to push the old reports out.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/64557172-chris","datetime":"2015-02-02","comments":[]}
