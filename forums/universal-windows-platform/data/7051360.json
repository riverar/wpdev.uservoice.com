Hope that Microsoft (if possible), allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store. With this, maybe it can attract more developers to publish an app on these two platforms of Microsoft specially to upcoming Windows10. Hope that this is possible.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/64650317-octaseals","datetime":"2015-02-04","comments":[]}
