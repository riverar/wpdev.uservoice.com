At best, this causes a loss of UX quality in some cases. In the case of Tap to Share, its absence is problematic, since the app has no way of telling whether to use ProximityDevice and PeerFinder to implement the function. Always implementing the NFC sharing regardless can make for a clumsy user interface.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/65344281-m","datetime":"2015-02-16","comments":[]}
