Right now it's impossible to automate unit testing a WinJS application. Instead we have to either create a second WinJS project  and link all of our source files to it, or add a special page into the app itself that's dedicated to unit testing.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68002572-josh-harms","datetime":"2015-03-21","comments":[]}
