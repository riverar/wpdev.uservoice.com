However, as the FilePicker only returns StorageItems, this isn't possible. The only workaround we have is to copy the file into a temporary folder, and get the path from there. Unfortunately this means the app is a none-starter, because the files can be several gigabytes in size, so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/68309979-mark-ingram","datetime":"2015-03-24","comments":[]}
