Currently this folder can be created only locally.  \n<br>  \n<br>It would be great to have the option for creating Publisher’s shared roaming folder as well. Typical scenario - Game publisher releases three games for Windows 10 and the goal is to have an option for sharing Best score from all games in all those games across all devices.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/32411334-martin-suchan","datetime":"2015-03-26","comments":[]}
