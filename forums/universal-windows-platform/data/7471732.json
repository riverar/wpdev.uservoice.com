Now, this may not be so bad in English, which has relatively short words, but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words. Words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed - especially on small screens.\n<br>With the new Universal App Platform in Windows, this is going to become far more relevant, as you no longer know what size you app can run at.\n<br>This would also bring feature parity with HTML/JS apps, which already have hyphenation support.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57897057-asbj%C3%B8rn","datetime":"2015-04-06","comments":[]}
