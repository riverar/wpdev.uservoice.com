This allows for easier editing when a 45 degree angle or another angle is needed. You could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier. At least for me.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/70617052-dehim-verveen","datetime":"2015-04-07","comments":[]}
