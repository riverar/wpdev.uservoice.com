Much like a codeplex or sourceforge project.\n<br>At the moment every app has its own web site which is rarely visited by users. This would improve communication between the user and the developers.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/74520450-alberto","datetime":"2015-05-02","comments":[]}
