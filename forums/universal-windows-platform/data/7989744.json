Their strategy was focused on UWP - but that has been slow to take off, not least because most app devs are focussing on the current mobile platforms - Android and IOS. So to speed things up, Microsoft are also focussing heavily on PWAs and also some \"other things\". Could one of those other things be incubating a true cross platform XAML based UI  technology, based on UWP?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/339553918-mike-eee","datetime":"2018-06-13","body":"Brave yet true, Robin. :)  There have been many (MANY!) resources put into UWP, and in its designer/Xaml system/APIs especially.  Those would all appear to be for naught now.  While it is one group in MSFT, it will not be long before others follow suit.  Can you point to an example where a group in MSFT (or any organization for that matter) gave a vote-of-no-confidence such as this towards another internally-produced product and it ended up in a better place?  Especially for how long UWP has been around?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/53453076-robin-sedlaczek","datetime":"2018-06-13","body":"1.
