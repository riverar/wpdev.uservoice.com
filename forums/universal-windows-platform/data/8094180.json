Users attempt to control apps via Cortana saying things the app developer didn't anticipate but which probably make sense.  When Cortana has an expression that it doesn't \"understand\" based on the available expressions registered, but Cortana does recognize an app name, it would be great if the user's expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future.  This creates a feedback loop that makes Cortana appear smarter and smarter.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/77798049-kburgoyne","datetime":"2015-05-23","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/65173386-diego-pierangeli","datetime":"2015-06-15","body":"For privacy reasons that should not be automatic.\n<br>Perhaps Cortana could ask the user 'can i send your query to the developer?'."}]}
