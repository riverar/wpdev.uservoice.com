It is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges. If I can schedule in advance that the Badge will be 1, one hour after execution, 2 at two hours after and so on, I wouldn't need a background task every half hour to check if the badge needs setting. It should follow the same rules as Scheduled Tile Updates.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/77932062-magoochris","datetime":"2015-05-24","comments":[]}
