It would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device. This way I could update tiles, change reminders or notifications across all devices. Even if it was linked to a specific settings name like \"HighPriority\" or a custom name would give even more specific tasks when certain things change.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/77932062-magoochris","datetime":"2015-05-24","comments":[]}
