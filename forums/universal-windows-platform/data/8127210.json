On iOS, this can be done by creating a keychain item with the attribute kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly. On Windows, there does not appear to be a way to add a PasswordCredential object to the PasswordVault with roaming disabled.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/14654261-eli-young","datetime":"2015-05-26","comments":[]}
