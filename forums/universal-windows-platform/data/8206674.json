Headers don't react to click/touch under certain circumstances, swiping doesn't change the active PivotItem most of the time. The content of the PivotItem seems too wide - wider than the SplitView Pane.\n<br>The Pivot behaves normally if I place it inside the SplitView Content though. So as far as I can tell the combination SplitView Pane + Pivot is the cause for this problem.\n<br>Why I want to do that? I want to achieve something similar to what Visual Studio Code does in its sidebar. But the Pivot fits perfect for my use case.","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/79263585-andreas-linnert","datetime":"2015-06-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/151150668-rafael-martins","datetime":"2016-03-12","body":"The soluction:"}]}
