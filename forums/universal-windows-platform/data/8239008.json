This new Frame class gives a lot of pain to developers, because in many cases it cannot provide such app and navigation state management, which can be used to create good and predictable user expirience. Therefore, I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frame's behavior closer to it's analog from WP Silverlight.","votes":"60","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/61479720-alex","datetime":"2015-06-05","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/37917638-srini","datetime":"2016-08-28","body":"This is why windows phone makes the developer cry.
