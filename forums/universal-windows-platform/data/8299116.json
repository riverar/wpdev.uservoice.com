It's very important for support legacy projects written on MFC. We have a big project written on MFC. Now we try to integrate some components written on C# (WPF, WCF...) and use asynchronous tasks. It's good if COM/COM+ technology continue with C++/CX and universal type system. And it's good if it will be work on Windows 7 too.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/18945678-andrey","datetime":"2015-06-09","comments":[]}
