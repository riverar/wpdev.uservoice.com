However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on \"Save\", which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned. Because this is SSO for phone, the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly. If I enter the *wrong* password, then the UI for the credentials prompt does not leave the prompt screen (because the password was not valid). This seems to be a serious security flaw with the API if it is allowing blank passwords to proceed as valid (while wrong passwords are treated as invalid).
