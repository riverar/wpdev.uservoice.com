At the moment you have to open the reviews for every app, one at the time. If you have many apps like me (about 40) it takes a lot of time. Maybe you can add an 'All Apps' option to the 'Page filter' of the reviews.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/83736385-fons-sonnemans","datetime":"2015-06-28","comments":[]}
