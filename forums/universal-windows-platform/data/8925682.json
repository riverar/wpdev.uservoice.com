The new single view at a time may let you display a landscape image on the pc store but on the phone it comes up squished in the center of a portrait format picture - so that doesn't buy you anything. If the app is a windows phone only app - cater to it.. instead of this one size shoe fits all. Not sure what the labels under the images do - they don't show up on the web page.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/88154641-francis-duranza","datetime":"2015-07-18","comments":[]}
