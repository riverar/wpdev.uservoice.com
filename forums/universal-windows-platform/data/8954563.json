I think this feature should be added by adding an option to the TextWrapping enumeration (maybe TextWrapping.FullLine or TextWrapping.NoWhitespace or TextWrapping.BreakAnywhere). I feel this is a very basic design style and is used often enough that it should be built into .NET &amp; XAML.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2015-07-20","comments":[]}
