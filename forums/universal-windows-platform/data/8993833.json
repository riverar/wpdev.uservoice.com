Debugging TypeScript code directly. Typing information for all the APIs, so it feels similar to C#.\n<br>I know, Angular 2 isn't ready just yet but I hope this is something we can look forward to.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/79263585-andreas-linnert","datetime":"2015-07-23","comments":[]}
