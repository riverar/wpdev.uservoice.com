I see no reason to have 3 variations that are so similar, especially with the current efforts to make things universal. I think having 3 variations (did I forget any?) does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration, and in the case of some people (although hopefully not many, and definitely not me), a reason to leave .NET. If all 3 variations could be merged, I think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2015-07-28","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/27214787-nathan-sokalski","datetime":"2018-11-25","body":"Another variation I should include here is UWP, since I often see a lot of code that is different or even unavailable between the two."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/211182684-gavin-williams","datetime":"2018-11-24","body":"This has been completed hasn't it?
