I had posted this on the VS uservoice site  <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/7542181-add-f-support-for-net-native\">https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/7542181-add-f-support-for-net-native</a> but it looks like that was the wrong place to do that. I hope the votes that request got will be considered for this. A lot of people are moving to F# PCLs for library code and to be able to use those PCLs in the UWP and get native compilation via .Net native tools would be great.","votes":"874","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/91493545-krishna","datetime":"2015-07-31","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/388618483-charles-roddie","datetime":"2018-09-13","body":"You will be able to create UWP store apps as of the next release.

This used to be one of the greatest groups in Microsoft, and now it is simply an embarrassment.  We are pushing nearly a decade now with the same mediocre featureset with no passion or desire for improvement.  Not supporting a .NET language in a .NET technology offering is the cherry topping on the cake of fail.
