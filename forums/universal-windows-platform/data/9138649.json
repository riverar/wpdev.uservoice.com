As an example, I place an MapIcon at a particular Lat/Long the rotate that MapIcon 156 deg. As the map is rotated the icon mains it;s relative rotation to the map. Prefer that i could stream  XAML or other vector as MapIcon source to it will scale correctly. Also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/91936969-rc-roeder","datetime":"2015-08-02","comments":[]}
