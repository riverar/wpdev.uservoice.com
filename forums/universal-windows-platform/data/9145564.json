We all have to use BackgroundMediaPlayer if we want the audio to continue even when the app is minimized. \n<br>However the BackgroundMediaPlayer doesn't have all the features the MediaElement had. \n<br>Please add the support of Audio Effects (e.g. Equalizer etc.) to the BackgroundMediaPlayer API. \n<br>Don't let the wonderful Windows 10 UAP be a downgrade on features. \n<br>It doesn't even have to support the full range of MFTs. Just input PCM and output PCM would be enough.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform","datetime":"2015-08-03","comments":[]}
