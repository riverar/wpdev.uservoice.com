Lumia 1520 takes screenshots in 1080x1920 size and having to resize 8 screenshots across multiple languages is not how a developer should spend time. 1080x1920 is the same aspect ratio as 720x1280 so it should be easily down scalable.","votes":"40","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/39813794-paras","datetime":"2015-08-20","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/329043412-schumi1331","datetime":"2017-02-10","body":"Also Lumia 950 resolution, don't think there should be a limit for sizes like it does not exist for PC and HoloLens"}]}
