We end up writing lot of custom Styles in XAML for Split view. Further, SPlitview should have option to display only the button in compact mode.Right now in compact mode the pane is always visible. There are few standard patterns for navigation and if Split view has those OOB then developing apps because a breeze. Developers should be focusing more on App as opposed to implement the standard navigation pattern and spend effort on styling.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/98223876","datetime":"2015-08-26","comments":[]}
