There will always be multiple apps that have the same keywords, so having more specific search options is pretty much a must."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/60342789","datetime":"2015-09-19","body":"The store search algorithm is broken.  Whichever team or person that designed it, should be fired.  The results returned right now for Best Rated and New and Rising are ridiculous.  Hundreds, if not thousands of apps have been completely removed from being searchable on the Windows Store due to some lame feature of the algorithm."}]}
