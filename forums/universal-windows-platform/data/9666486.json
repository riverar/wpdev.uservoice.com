Especially some company needs to complicated process when personal credit card is used for such purpose. When Microsoft sends a money between the company for your business partner for example outsourced call center, do you use  credit card for such payment? Obviously Not. Developers is your partner and allow to use bank transfer for registration.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/92336389-n-s","datetime":"2015-09-07","comments":[]}
