They said that use commerce.microsoft.com instead of formal invoice.\n<br>Have you ever seen the \"invoice\" in the commerce.microsoft.com?\n<br>If you do not yet, I highly recommend to open \"show print version\".\n<br>It is extremely poor \"invoice\", no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementary school student? This is elementary school level invoice. What kind of joking? If you are professional developer, redesign (your company loves this word) the formal business invoice!","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/92336389-n-s","datetime":"2015-09-07","comments":[]}
