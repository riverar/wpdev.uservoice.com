This is not possbile for UAP apps.\n<br>Another, even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an \"open with...\"-option in the built-in photos app. This option is already present in the desktop variant of the app, but missing in the mobile app.","votes":"9","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/104355372-t","datetime":"2015-09-19","comments":[]}
