I would like to have the ability to delete all of Scheduled Toast Notifications with one built-in method which won't affect performance of my app. It would be nice if I could add simple switch in settings to let user turn ON/OFF notifications (which is done by deleting existing ones).","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/106502187","datetime":"2015-09-28","comments":[]}
