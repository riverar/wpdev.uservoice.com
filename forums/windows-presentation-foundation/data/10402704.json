Currently the systems we manage are written in VB6 and .Net Winforms. We are deliberating between WPF and ASP.Net MVC . While WPF will provide an easier upgrade path and also enable us to launch existing thick client systems directly, we are concerned with its support and future strategy. Can you please help and let us know the future roadmap. Any documentation / new article in this front will really help.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667733-anonymous","datetime":"2015-10-26","comments":[]}
