What should I choose for new development now? Why is there so much variation in the libraries and toolsets? How do I know that anything I choose is not going to be abandoned by MS in one year's time - like .NET in WinRT? WPF seems like an abandoned building - every WPF question that I look up on Stack Overflow was answered between 2008 and 2010, unlike the MS web stack which is constantly evolving. MS, please support Windows programming with a clear and coherent vision, and then make a single XAML team to stop the current fragmentation.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667739-rob-kent","datetime":"2015-11-02","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251678785-dir","datetime":"2015-11-02","body":"WPF doesn't look that dead (anymore). .NET 4.6 had some news for WPF, and the WPF team announced further improvements for .NET 4.6.1 just a few days ago."}]}
