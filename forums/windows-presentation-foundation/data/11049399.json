Neither the test builder tool's crosshair nor Ctrl+I combination are able to identify the error message. The reason for this behaviour seems to be design of the control as a hidden control.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667928-chethan-s","datetime":"2015-12-10","comments":[]}
