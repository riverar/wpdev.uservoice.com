(And why not update the snippet to use the nameof operator for the declaring class name if you're using C# 6, anyway? Would make refactoring so much easier!) Anyway, if I could declare dependency properties in XAML, I think that would be much more intuitive.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667745-ed-kolis","datetime":"2016-01-05","comments":[]}
