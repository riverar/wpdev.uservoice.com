Instead of having to alter XAML code or physically alter the main window dimensions for every new window created why not provide a default configuration setting for the main window size so that every new item that is added to a project has the same default main window size?","votes":"3","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667766-jim-withnall","datetime":"2016-03-03","comments":[]}
