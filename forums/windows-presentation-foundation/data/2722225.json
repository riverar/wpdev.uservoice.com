This could be a very special thing to have the possibility to use OpenGL fully supported by WPF, without airspace iusse.\n<br>Now it's possible the integration using HwndHost or WindowsFormsHost but it's not possible to have other WPF control over this, and it's impossible to apply effects and transitions.","votes":"1,422","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251679520-marco","datetime":"2012-03-28","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/792223999","datetime":"2019-07-09","body":"Maybe with .Net Core 3?"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/36924865-horeaper","datetime":"2018-06-07","body":"6 years later, nothing happened."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251683663-kirill","datetime":"2016-07-21","body":"+100"}]}
