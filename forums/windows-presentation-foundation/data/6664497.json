Maybe a setting on the datagrid, so it behaves like a grid you have in the SQL Server Management Studio, where the grid adds a new row as soon as you edit a column on the last row. \n<br>And one that adds a new row when you tab out of the last column, and then sets the focus on the first column on the newly added row. There may be other options, but these two would be a great thing to have."}]}
