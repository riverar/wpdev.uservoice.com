A question was asked about integration with WPF and quite predictably the speaker didn't address the question and said he would have a private conversation after the talk.  It is clear that quite a deliberate decision has been made with Win2D to cut WPF out of the loop.  With pressure and a change of heart from MS about the future of desktop apps they might backport it possibly.  I personally doubt it though.   "}]}
