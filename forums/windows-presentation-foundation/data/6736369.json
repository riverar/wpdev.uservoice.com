I suggest that you fully integrate SWF controls into WPF so they appropriately handle the z-order, opacity, zoom, and other WPF properties.","votes":"16","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251668984-ken-bevins","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251675059-denis","datetime":"2015-04-03","body":"Fully agreed with this suggestion. Airspace issues must be fixed. Besides, they were fixed already in .Net 4.5 alpha, but this feature was removed from framework by unknown reason."}]}
