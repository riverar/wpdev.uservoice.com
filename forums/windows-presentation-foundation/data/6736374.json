(D3DResourceType only allows for IDirect3DSurface9.)  It would be nice if it directly supported DX11, which would allow many of the newer graphics features to work cleanly in WPF.   [I realize there would likely be a performance loss in converting the surface formats to work with WPF's DX9 infrastructure, but this could be handled completely internally, and as efficiently as possible.]","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251668087-reed-copsey-jr","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
