The installer take 240 MB for 3.5sp1, take 50+ for .net4. And after deployment, it might take 500~ 1000 MB for hard drive. The cold/cool startup is also a issue compared to MFC. But actually, .net 2.0 have the overhead, WPF based on it make it worse.   If these issues are hard to resolved, maybe there's some tricky ways to  try to resolve them in OS level such as pre-installed, pre-cached some essential modules, ...etc. ( Win7 include 3.p5 sp1 in default, how about in the future for .net4)?","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667640-anonymous","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
