We need the same thing built for WPF and Silverlight that embraces the MVVM model and support convention based programming.  Get rid of code-behind!  Full support for binding to a view model.  Let the ViewModel select which view to use and not the other way around.  Include tooling support for this.","votes":"14","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/57632041-robert-cannon","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
