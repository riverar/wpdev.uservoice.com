Some things could be as simple as applying the ContentProperty attribute intelligently. For example, why do I need to specify Setter.Value? Setter's default content property should already be its Value property. Same with DataGrid.Columns. DataForm is an improvement in Silverlight but still not perfect. A simple label/field layout should be a first class use case in XAML.","votes":"5","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667964-josh-einstein","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
