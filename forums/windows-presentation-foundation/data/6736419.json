You could use that in your DirectShow filter graph or MF topology. \n<br>At the moment, the possibilities for using DirectShow/MF in a WPF application are dissatisfying: you can use a native window for video rendering (with all the airspace issues), you can use the combination of an EVR custom presenter and a D3DImage (it is awkward and uses the UI thread for updating the video image), and of course you can use MediaElement with all its limitations (video playback only). \n<br>We badly need a media framework in WPF (even Silverlight has one), so why not use the existing frameworks DirectShow and Media Foundation and just add the missing link.","votes":"6","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/52937711-markusml","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
