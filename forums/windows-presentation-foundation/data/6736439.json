The application  button is not the right color, nor is the ribbon tab the right gradient. There are some necessary animations not done, while there are animations not found in the Windows Ribbon. The buttons in the ribbon control group do not look similar to the Windows Ribbon buttons at all. I suggest that the WPF Ribbon be made more realistic before any additional development is done.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667859-rayner-lim","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
