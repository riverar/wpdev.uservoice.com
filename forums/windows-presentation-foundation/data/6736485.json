This means no intellisense, no compile time check. A great enhancement would be to write a lambda expression in the XAML, just like in ASP.NET MVC Views. We would have compile time errors instead of run time errors, and support for refactoring.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667874-nicolas-s%C3%A9veno","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251671192-bruno-almeida","datetime":"2015-03-31","body":"Please check this older idea: <a rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" href=\"https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/6230747-make-xaml-bindings-type-save\">https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/6230747-make-xaml-bindings-type-save</a>"}]}
