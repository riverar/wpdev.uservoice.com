Many companies create touch apps in WPF, because it is possible to control the hardware better than in WinRT. It is also important to implement touch - controls, so that the developer doesn't need to do the basics. \n<br>I developed a touch App for a bus driver (ticket sell, road control, ...) (2 years work!) and it was my main Problem, to implement the touch in such a way like WinRT. A Pivot control, which was on the top view Level, was also an important part of the Project. It is really difficult to make Projects with WPF for touch!"}]}
