It seems like there needs to be a more granular method to customizing the control without having to copy and edit the entire control template. It is not always clear what parts of a control template the control depends on such that replacing the template leads to subtle bugs in the controls behavior or display.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251667700-jim-brown","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
