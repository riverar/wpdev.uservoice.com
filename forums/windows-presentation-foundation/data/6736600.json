It could consist of 4 simple functions:\n<br>Handle = Open_Connection(Unique_ID, Connection_Type(USB_Hid| | BlueThooth | Direct_Wifi);\n<br>ReturnCode = Send_Message(Handle, message, messagelength);\n<br>ReturnCode = Receive_Message(Handle, message, messagelength);\n<br>Close(Handle);\n<br>The whole idea is to give programmers lots of power without having them deal with tons of complexity.","votes":"1","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251694547-jim-kirkley","datetime":"2014-11-18","comments":[]}
