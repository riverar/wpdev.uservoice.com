This will allow dramatic code simplification. For example, binding to a variable property without Dynamic Properties ICustomTypeProvider, without Reflection  and without complex MultiBindings with converters.","votes":"7","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251668480-anonymous","datetime":"2014-12-07","comments":[]}
