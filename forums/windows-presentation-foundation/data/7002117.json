WPF (or a more standardized similar form) should be the STANDARD for building ANY UI, and the developer should choose whether to optimize their UI for touch or desktop.\n<br>WPF (or this new standard) should incorporate (abstract) ALL other technologies (like native DirectX 11/12 support) and should have an easier, more complete toolset for tasks like building controls, binding, and globalization. Make this the standard of building simple or complex resolution/dpi agnostic, hardware accelerated UI for the unforeseeable future, with full support from the Windows team for years to come. Make it run natively in the OS layer and remove ALL of the unnecessary clutter/overhead associated with the current incarnation of WPF.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251669497-fahad","datetime":"2015-01-23","comments":[]}
