Microsoft is always trying to get the number of apps in the app store increased. Why not help us WPF devs get our Desktop apps in the app store so that we can sell our Desktop apps through the store? Why not develop tools and API's that mean WPF apps can even run as WinRT apps? Dare I say it even run on iOs/Android in the Open Source .Net world. We like C#/Wpf/Visual Studio and we want to continue to work with these tools. Finally please also improve WPF rendering performance! This is the most important performance improvement that WPF needs.","votes":"4","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251668105-anonymous","datetime":"2015-02-12","comments":[{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251696977-anonymous","datetime":"2015-03-08","body":"WPF is abandonware.\n"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251696986-mcoder14","datetime":"2015-03-05","body":"Yes VB6 programming is the way to increase the number of apps in the app store."},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251672845-pacmani","datetime":"2015-02-14","body":"@MariusOrion please do not spam with offtopic nonsense"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251696992-mariusorion","datetime":"2015-02-14","body":"@PacMani"},{"user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251672845-pacmani","datetime":"2015-02-12","body":"Microsoft is killing off legacy desktop software.
