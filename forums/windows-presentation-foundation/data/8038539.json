Please add a SplitButton control that looks and acts like a standard control. It should both allow to act like a button (clicking on main body and dropdown arrow open a dropdown) and like an actual split button, where clicking on the main body executes a command and clicking on the arrow opens a dropdown button.","votes":"2","user":"https://wpdev.uservoice.com/users/251677579-floele","datetime":"2015-05-20","comments":[]}
